1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay, next type of database we have

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
is Redshift.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Redshift is a database

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
that is based on PostgreSQL,

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
but it's not used for OLTP.

6
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
OLTP stands for Online Transaction Processing.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That is what RDS was good for.

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Instead, Redshift is OLAP,

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
or Online Analytic Analytical Processing,

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
which is used to do analytics and data warehousing.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So anytime in the exam you're saying a database

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
needs to be a warehouse and to do analytics on it,

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
then Redshift is going to be your answer.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
With Redshift, you don't load the data continuously.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You load it, for example, every hour.

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And the idea with Redshift that is really,

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
really good at analyzing data and making some computations.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So it boasts 10x better performance

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
than other data warehouses and scales to petabytes of data.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The data is stored in columns,

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
so it's called a columnar storage

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
of data instead of row-based.

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So anytime you see columnar, again,

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
think Redshift, and it has something called

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
the Massively Parallel Query Execution MPP engine

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
to do these computations very, very quickly.

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's pay as you go based

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
on the instances you have provisioned,

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and has a SQL interface to perform the queries.

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's also finally integrated with BI,

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
so business intelligence tools such as QuickSight or Tableau

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
if you wanted to create dashboards on top of your data

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
in your data warehouse.

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So that's it.

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Just a high level overview, but a data warehouse is used

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
to do some computation on your data sets

37
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and do some analytics,

38
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and possibly build some kind of visualizations

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
through dashboards on it.

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And so for that use case, Redshift

41
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
would be perfect.

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We now have a feature

43
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
for Redshift called Redshift Serverless,

44
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
and this allows you to run Redshift but not worry

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
about scaling the data warehouse or provisioning it.

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
(indistinct) does it for us,

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
that's what it's called, serverless.

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So the idea is that you're going

49
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
to run your analytics workloads

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
without managing data warehouse infrastructure,

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
which is very handy, and you're only going to pay

52
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
for what you use, which allows you to save on costs.

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So the use cases will be to do reporting

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
or dashboarding applications, or realtime analytics,

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
but again, without managing the underlying capacity

56
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and the infrastructure

57
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
of your Redshift Serverless database.

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So how does that work?

59
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Well, you just enable Amazon Redshift Serverless

60
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
on your account.

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Then you connect the Redshift Query Editor

62
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
or any other tool to start writing your queries,

63
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
and then automatically Redshift Serverless is going

64
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
to run these queries and provision and scale capacity based

65
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
on the workload and the query itself.

66
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Finally, you only pay for compute

67
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and storage used during the analysis,

68
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
which makes it a very cost efficient option

69
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
to running Redshift,

70
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and the exam can test you on it as well.

71
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Okay, so that's it for this lecture.

72
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
