1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now, let's talk about Amazon Neptune.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Neptune is a fully-managed graph database.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So an example of what a graph dataset would be,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
would be, for example, something we all know

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
which is a social network.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So, if we look at a social network,

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
people are friends, they like, they connect,

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
they read, they comment and so on.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So users have friends, posts will have comments,

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
comments have likes from users,

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
users shares and like posts

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and so, all these things are interconnected

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and so, they create a graph.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And so, this is why Neptune is a great choice

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
of database when it comes to graph datasets.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So, Neptune has replication across 3 AZ,

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
up to 15 read replicas.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's used to build and run applications

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
that are gonna be with highly connected datasets,

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
so like a social network,

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and because Neptune is optimized to run queries

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
that are complex and hard on top of these graph datasets.

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You can store up to billions of relations on the database

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and query the graph with milliseconds latency.

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's highly available with application

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
across multiple Availability Zones.

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And it's also great for storing knowledge graphs.

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
For example, the Wikipedia database is a knowledge graph

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
because all the Wikipedia articles are interconnected

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
with each other, fraud detection,

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
recommendations engine and social networking.

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So, coming from an exam perspective,

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
anytime you see anything related to graph databases,

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
think no more than Neptune.

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That's it.

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
