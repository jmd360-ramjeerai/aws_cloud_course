1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Okay, so now let's talk about

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
DynamoDB global tables.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So this is a one feature need to know about for DynamoDB.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's a way for you to make DynamoDB table

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
accessible with low latency and this is the key

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
in multiple regions.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So let's take an example.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We have our DynamoDB table in us-east-one,

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and we'll set up as a global table.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So the basics, of course, our users can do read and write

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
to this DynamoDB table in Northern Virginia us-east-one.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
But it is possible for us

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
to set up some replication for this global table.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So we can create a global table in Paris eu-west-three

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and we'll say they're the same,

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
so there's two way replication between these tables.

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That means that the same data is in us-east-one

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and in eu-west-three,

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
but users, you know, there are close to the Paris region,

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
can access this global table with low latency in Paris.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So this is true for one to 10 regions, if you want it to.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Okay.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
A global table is truly global

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and users can read and write

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
to the table in any specific region,

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
there will just be replication between these two.

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So the fact that there is read/write access

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
to any region of AWS on this global table,

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
makes it an active-active replication

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
because you can actively write to any region

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and it will actively be replicated into other regions. Okay.

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So that's it, all you need to know for the exam.

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I will see you in the next session.
