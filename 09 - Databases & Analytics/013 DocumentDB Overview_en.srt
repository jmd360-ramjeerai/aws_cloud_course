1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now let's talk about DocumentDB.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So the same way we had Aurora as the way for AWS

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
to implement a sort of big cloud native version

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
of PostgreSQL and MySQL,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
we have DocumentDB, which is an Aurora version for MongoDB.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So MongoDB, if you don't know,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
that's the logo on the top right corner of your screen,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
it is another no SQL database

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and you need to remember this for the exam.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So DocumentDB is a no SQL database

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and it's based on top of the MongoDB technology.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So it's compatible with MongoDB.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So MongoDB is used to store query and index JSON data,

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and you have the same similar deployment concept

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
as Aurora with DocumentDB.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So that means it's a fully managed database,

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
it's highly available.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Data is replicated across three availability zones

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and DocumentDB storage automatically will grow

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
in increments of 10 gigabytes,

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and DocumentDB has been engineered

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
so it can scale to workloads

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
with millions of requests per second.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So at the exam, if you see anything related to MongoDB,

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
think DocumentDB, or if you see anything related

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
to no SQL databases, think DocumentDB and also DynamoDB.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That's it for this lecture.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I hope you liked it,

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and I will see you in the next lecture.
