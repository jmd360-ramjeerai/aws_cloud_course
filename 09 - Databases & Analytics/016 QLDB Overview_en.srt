1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now let's talk about Amazon QLDB,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
which stands for Quantum Ledger Database.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So what is it?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
A ledger is a book recording financial transactions

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and so QLDB is going to be just to have a ledger

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
of financial transactions.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's a fully managed database, it's serverless,

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
highly available, and has replication of data

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
across three availability T zones.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And it's used to review history of all the changes

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
made to your application data over time,

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
that's why it's called a ledger.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So it's an immutable system as well,

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
that means that once you write something to the database,

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
it can not be removed or modified.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And there is also a way to have a cryptographic signature

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
to make sure that indeed nothing has been removed.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So how does it work?

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Well, there is behind the scenes a journal,

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and so a journal has a sequence of modifications.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And so anytime a modification is made,

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
there is a cryptographic hash that is computed

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
which guarantees that nothing has been deleted or modified

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and so this can be verified by anyone using the database.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So this is extremely helpful for financial transactions

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
because you wanna make sure that

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
obviously no financial transaction

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
is disappearing from your database

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
which makes QLDB a great ledger database in the cloud.

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So you get two to three times better performance

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
than common ledger blockchain frameworks

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and also you can manipulate data using SQL.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Now, as you'll see in the next lecture

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
there's also another database technologies

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
called Amazon Managed Blockchain.

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
But the difference between QLDB and Managed Blockchain

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
is that with QLDB, there is no concept of decentralization.

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
That means that there's just a central database

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
owned by Amazon that allows you to write this journal.

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Okay.

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And this is in line with many financial regulation rules.

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So the difference between QLDB and Managed Blockchain

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
is that QLDB has a central authority component

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and it's a ledger, whereas managed blockchain

45
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
is going to have a de-centralization component as well.

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Okay.

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So that's it, anytime you see financial transactions

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and ledger, think QLDB.

49
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I will see you in the next lecture.
