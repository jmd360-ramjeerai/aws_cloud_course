1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So now let's talk about Amazon Timestream.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And, as there's a hint in the name, it is for time series.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So it's a database that is fully managed, fast, scalable,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and serverless for time series data.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So what is time series data?

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Well, it's data that is evolving over time.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So, for example, here on the vertical axis we have a number,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and on the horizontal axis we have the year

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
that is evolving from an older date to a newer date.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And so because the date is evolving over time,

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
we are talking about a time series datasets.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So Timestream is just for that,

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and there's automatic scaling up and down

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
based on capacity and the need of computes.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You can store and analyze trillions

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
of events per day in time series form.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's about a thousand times faster

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and one 1/10th of the cost of relational databases.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
On top of it, if you want to analyze

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
the time series data in real time,

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
you could have time series analytics function

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
to find your pattern in your database.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So, whenever at the exam you see time series data,

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
think no more than Amazon Timestream.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
All right, that's it.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
