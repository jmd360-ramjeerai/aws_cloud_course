1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So now let's talk about Amazon Athena.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Amazon Athena is a serverless query service

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
to perform analytics against your objects

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
stored in Amazon S3.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So the idea is that you would use the SQL query language to

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
create these files, but you don't need to load them.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They just need to be in S3 and Athena will do the rest.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So these files can be formatted in different ways,

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
such as CSV, JSON, ORC, Avro, and Parquet

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and the Athena is built on the Presto engine,

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
if you must know.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Now, how does it work?

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So users will load it into Amazon S3,

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and then Amazon Athena will be used

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
to query and analyze the data.

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Very, very simple.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And then if you wanted to,

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
you could have some reporting on top of Athena,

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
such as using Amazon QuickSight.

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Now the pricing for Athena is around

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
$5 per terabyte of data scanned.

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And if you use compressed

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
or data stored in a columnar fashion,

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
then you're going to have cost savings

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
because there is less scan of the data being made.

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So the use cases of Athena are multiple,

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
but anytime you see Business intelligence,

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
analytics, or reporting,

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
or to analyze Flow Logs in VPC or ELB Logs,

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
or CloudTrail logs, or platform logs,

31
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
all these kinds of logs in AWS,

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
then Athena's going to be a really, really good option.

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So from an exam perspective,

34
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
whenever you see serverless analyze data in S3

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
use SQL, then think Amazon Athena.

36
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That's it.

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I hope you liked it.

38
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And I will see you in the next lecture.
