00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
So we have seen in this section

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
so many different database technologies

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and the question is how do you migrate data

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
from one database to another?

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
For this we can use DMS which is properly named

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
the Database Migration Service.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So we use source database and once we extract the data

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
so we'll run an EC2 instance

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
that will be running the DMS software.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We'll extract the data from the source database

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and then DMS will insert the data back

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
into a target database that will be somewhere else.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So with DMS we get a quick and secure database migration

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
into AWS that's going to be resilient and self healing.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And the cherry on the cake,

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
the source database remains available during the migration

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
so we don't have to take it down.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It supports many kinds of migration.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So one it's called an homogeneous migration

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
where you have Oracle to Oracle for example.

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So it's the same database technology for the source database

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and the target database.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Or it supports heterogeneous migrations

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
when the source database technology

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and the target are different for example

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
a Microsoft SQL Server to Aurora.

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And in that case, DMS is smart enough

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
to know how to convert data

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
from the source into the target.

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So any time in the exam you see migration of a database,

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
DMS is going to be the answer for it.

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I hope that was helpful

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and I will see you in the next lecture.
