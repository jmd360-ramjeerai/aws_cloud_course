1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
So let's go ahead

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
and create our first database in RDS.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And we're not going to go over all the options,

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
but we're going to see the general idea

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
of RDS and how it works.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So, on the left hand side, I will go under Databases

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and I will create a database.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So here, we have the interface.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And so we have a standard create and an easy create.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So an easy create is to use recommended

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
best-practice configurations,

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
whereas the standard create allows you

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
to just customize everything.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So, for the purpose of this demonstration,

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I will use a standard create.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So we have different options of the engine.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We have Aurora, MySQL, MariaDB,

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So, in this demo, we're going to launch

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
a very simple managed MySQL database using RDS,

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
but we can see that there is a lot

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
of options available to us.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We'll use the MySQL Community,

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and then we'll use the latest version that is recommended,

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
8.0.23, but it really doesn't matter.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Here, we have some templates

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
to launch our MySQL RDS database.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We have the Production template,

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
the Dev/Test template, or the Free Tier template,

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
which is quite nice because it pre-fills

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
some of the settings from below.

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And we'll see what I mean.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So if we go into the free tier,

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
because we wanna stay within the free tier.

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let's scroll down.

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
For the DB identifier, I will use database-1. This is fine.

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Here, there is a master username. So admin is great.

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And then, the password, I will enter password twice.

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And then, I will scroll down.

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The database class is now a burstable class of T2 micro.

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Well, that's the only one I can actually enter here

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
because I went with the Free Tier setting.

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
But if I went with, for example, Production setting,

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I could be choosing another type of class,

45
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
for example, any kind of class in here.

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But again, we'll stay within the free tier

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and use a T2 micro type of database.

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'll scroll down, we have some settings around storage.

49
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We can enable 20 gigabytes of gp2 SSD storage,

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and then we can have storage autoscaling.

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
In case we are having more storage than 20 gigabytes,

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
it will automatically increase the storage for us

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
with a maximum of one terabyte, 1,000 gigabytes in here.

54
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Availability and durability,

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
for now, we will not go over these settings.

56
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Connectivity, so where do we want to launch the database?

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So we specify a virtual private cloud, or a VPC,

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
as well as a subnet group.

59
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Do we want to have public access to our database? Yes or no?

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Well, you need to specify yes

61
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
if you want to be able to connect

62
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
to your database from your computer

63
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
if you don't have direct connectivity into AWS,

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
which should be the case for you,

65
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
so we'll keep it as yes public access.

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Then, we should assign some security group.

67
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So you can create a new security group.

68
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'll call it demo-database-rds.

69
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And the AZ is going to be no preference. This is fine.

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And database port is 3306. Excellent.

71
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Now, how do we want to authenticate the database?

72
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Using password or password and IAM or password and Kerberos.

73
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We'll keep it very simple

74
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and use it with password authentication.

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And we will not go over any additional configuration for now

76
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
because there could be a lot for you.

77
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But so, as we can see here, we have the RDS Free Tier.

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's available for us for 12 months,

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
and then we'll get 725,

80
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
basically, a full month of RDS free every month

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
for the db.t2.micro instance

82
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
as well as 20 gigabytes free of SSD,

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
so, again, this is what we selected,

84
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and some space for backups.

85
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So we'll create this database.

86
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So it took a few minutes, but now my database is created.

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And here, we have some summary.

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So we know where it is launched,

89
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
for example, eu-central-1a.

90
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
We get some information around the endpoint.

91
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
If you wanted to connect to it,

92
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
this would be the endpoint and the port to be using.

93
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
We can have a look at the VPC security group

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
that has been created for my RDS instance

95
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
and the inbound rules.

96
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We can see there's an inbound rule on the port,

97
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
and if I scroll right,

98
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
on the port 3306 into my instance.

99
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So that means that I can use the correct port

100
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
to connect to my MySQL database instance.

101
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Perfect.

102
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
If we look into Monitoring,

103
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
because this is a managed service,

104
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
we have some information around the CPU utilization,

105
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
which is great.

106
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So we start really seeing the power of Managed Services,

107
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
login events, and so on.

108
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Configuration, Backups, and Tags.

109
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So, as we can see, having a database in the cloud

110
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
is really helpful when it's managed

111
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
because, well, we have all the nice monitoring,

112
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
configuration, settings, and so on, associated with it,

113
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
so this is a huge advantage.

114
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Other things you can do

115
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
is that you can take a snapshot of your database,

116
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
and this snapshot will allow you, for example,

117
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
to restore the database into another one.

118
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So let's do it, demo-snapshot, and we'll take the snapshot.

119
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So we can't do it because my database is still

120
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
in a backup stage, so what I'm going to do is wait for it

121
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
to not be backed up, but to be available.

122
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Okay, so my database is now available.

123
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So let's go back to Actions, Take Snapshot,

124
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
and here's my snapshot name.

125
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Take the snapshot.

126
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Now, my snapshot is being created.

127
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And with it, I have a few options.

128
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So I can click on it and I can do a few things.

129
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So let's wait for it to be created.

130
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Right now, it's in the Creating status.

131
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So my snapshot is now available,

132
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and what I can do is do Action, Restore Snapshot,

133
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
and this would allow me to create a new database

134
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
out of this snapshot.

135
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And the reason why I would do so is that, for example,

136
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
you wanted to create a bigger database

137
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
or create a copy of the database and so on,

138
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
or create a different settings for your database.

139
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Then, restoring a snapshot would be the way to do it.

140
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So I'm going to cancel this.

141
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Other things you can do with your snapshot is to copy it.

142
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So you can copy it to a different region.

143
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And this would be extremely helpful

144
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
if you wanted to restore the database

145
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
into another region of AWS,

146
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
for example, for disaster recovery.

147
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So yet another very handy feature.

148
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Another thing you can do is share the snapshot.

149
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And sharing the snapshot allows you

150
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
to share with other accounts

151
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
so they can restore their database

152
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
directly from your snapshot.

153
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So again, another very handy feature.

154
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So that's it for RDS, just as a quick overview.

155
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So again, we've created a database,

156
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and we've created a snapshot out of it,

157
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
and we saw different options.

158
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So you can see, Managed Services really have a good impact

159
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
on how you use the cloud,

160
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
and they really speed it up for you

161
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
to make sure that you don't manage too much infrastructure.

162
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So just to finish this hands-on,

163
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
let's delete this snapshot,

164
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
and then we're also going to delete this database

165
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
by doing Action, Delete,

166
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
and then you don't want to create a final snapshot,

167
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
you do not want to retain automated backups,

168
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
and you acknowledge that everything will be deleted,

169
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
then you type delete me, and you're good to go.

170
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So that's it for this lecture.

171
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I hope you liked it,

172
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
and I will see you in the next lecture.
