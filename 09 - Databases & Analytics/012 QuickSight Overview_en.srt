00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now let's talk about Amazon QuickSight.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So it's a serverless, machine learning-powered

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
business intelligence service

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
to create interactive dashboards.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So behind this very complicated tagline,

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
all you have to remember is that Amazon QuickSight

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
allows you to create dashboards on your databases

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
so we can visually represent your data

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and show your business users

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
the insights they're looking for, okay.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So QuickSight allows you to create

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
all these kind of cool graphs, charts, and so on.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So it's fast, it's automatically scalable.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's embeddable and there's per-session pricing,

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
so you don't have to provision any servers.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The use cases are business analytics,

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
building visualizations, performing ad-hoc analysis,

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
get business insights using data.

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And in terms of integrations, there are so many,

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
but, for example, QuickSight can run on top

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
of your RDS database, it can run on top of Aurora,

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Athena, Redshift, Amazon S3, and so on.

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So QuickSight is your go-to tool for DI in AWS.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That's it. I will see you in the next lecture.
