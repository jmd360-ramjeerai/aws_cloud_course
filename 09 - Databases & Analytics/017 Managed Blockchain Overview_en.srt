1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Now let's talk about,

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Amazon Managed Blockchain.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So what is Blockchain?

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It makes it possible to build applications

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
where multiple parties can execute transactions

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
without the need for trusted central authority.

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So there's a decentralization aspect to a Blockchain.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So managed Blockchain by Amazon,

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
is a service to join a public Blockchain networks

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
or create your own scalable private

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Blockchain network within AWS.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And it's compatible with two Blockchain so far,

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
the framework Hyperledger Fabric,

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and the framework Ethereum.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So from an exam perspective,

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
if you see anything related to Blockchains

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
or Hyperledger fabric or Ethereum,

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
you have to think Amazon managed Blockchain

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
which is also a decentralized Blockchain, okay?

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So make sure you remember that and that's it,

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
all you want to know for the exam,

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
you'll need to be Blockchain experts.

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So that's it, I hope you liked it,

24
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and I will see you in the next lecture.
