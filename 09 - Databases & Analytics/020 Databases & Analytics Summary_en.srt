1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So let's summarize everything we know

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
about databases and analytics in AWS.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And you just need to know what database corresponds

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
to what use case going into the exam.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So if you have a relational database

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and you have OLTP, so online transaction processing,

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
you have to think RDS and Aurora,

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and both these databases support the SQL language,

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Sequel language to query your data.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You also need to know for RDS the difference

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
between a multi-AZ deployment, read replicas,

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and multi-regions, as well as their use cases.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
If you need to find an in-memory database

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
or in-memory cache, think ElastiCache.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
If you're looking for a key/value database,

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
think DynamoDB, which is a serverless database.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And if you need caching technology for DynamoDB,

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
then use the DAX technology,

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
which is a cache made specifically for DynamoDB.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
If you're looking for a web data warehousing

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
or OLAP online analytical processing,

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
then you need to look at Redshift,

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
which is a warehousing technology.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And you can also use the SQL language

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
to query data on Redshift.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If you're trying to build a Hadoop cluster

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
to do big data analysis, use the EMR service.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
If you want to query data on Amazon S3

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
in a serverless fashion with a SQL language,

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
then use Athena.

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
QuickSight is a way to create dashboards

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
of visually interactives, visuals,

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and so on that can be interactive

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
as well on your data in a serverless fashion,

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
then you would use Amazon QuickSight,

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
also used for business intelligence.

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
DocumentDB is what I call the Aurora of MongoDB.

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So anytime you see MongoDB, think DocumentDB,

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
which is also using the JSON type of data sets.

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And this is a NoSQL database.

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So this is another NoSQL database on top of DynamoDB.

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Then we have Amazon QLDB,

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
which is a financial transaction ledger.

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Anytime you would see financial transaction,

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
immutable journal,

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
something that is cryptographically verifiable,

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
think Amazon QLDB.

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And this is a central database

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
which is opposed to a decentralized database,

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
which is Amazon Managed Blockchain,

51
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
in which case we can have managed Hyperledger Fabric

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and Ethereum blockchains on AWS.

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Finally, if you want to have a managed extract,

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
transform and load tool, so ETL, we can use Glue,

55
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
which also has a data catalog service

56
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
to discover data sets into your various databases in AWS.

57
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
If you need to move data between databases,

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
please use DMS, which is Database Migration Service.

59
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
If you want a graph database, you must choose Neptune.

60
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And if you want to use a time-series database,

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
you must use Amazon Timestream.

62
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Okay, so that's it for this lecture.

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
