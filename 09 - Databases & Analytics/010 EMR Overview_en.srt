1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Another type of database we have

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
on AWS is Amazon EMR, and EMR stands for Elastic MapReduce.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So EMR is actually not really a database.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's to create what's called a Hadoop cluster

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
when you wanna do big data on AWS,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and a Hadoop cluster is used to analyze

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and process vast amount of data.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So Hadoop is an open source technology,

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and they allow multiple servers that work in a cluster

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
to analyze the data together, and so when you're using EMR,

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
you can create a cluster made of hundreds of EC2 instances

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
that will be collaborating together to analyze your data.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So part of the Hadoop ecosystem, the Big Data ecosystem,

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
you will see projects names such as Apache Spark, HBase,

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Presto, and Flink, and all these things

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
will be working on top of your Hadoop cluster.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So what is EMR then?

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Well, EMR takes care of provisioning all these EC2 instances

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and configuring them so that they work together

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and can analyze together data from a big data perspective.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Finally, it has auto-scaling

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and it is integrated with Spot instances,

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and the use cases for EMR will be data processing,

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
machine learning, web indexing, or big data in general.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So from an exam perspective,

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
any time you see Hadoop cluster,

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
think no more, it's going to be Amazon EMR.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
That's it, I hope that was helpful,

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and I will see you in the next lecture.
