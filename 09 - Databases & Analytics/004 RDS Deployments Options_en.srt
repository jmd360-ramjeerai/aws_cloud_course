1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So when you deploy RDS databases, you need to understand

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
there are multiple architectural choices

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
you need to make, that you can make, actually.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So the first is to use RDS Read Replica.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So let's take the example of your application,

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
that reads from your main RDS database.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But say that now you need to scale the read workloads,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
we have more and more applications

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
that need to read more and more data from RDS.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The way you can do it is by creating Read Replica.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So that means that there is gonna be some copies,

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
some replicas of your RDS database

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
that are going to be created.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And this is going to allow your applications

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
to read from this Read Replica also.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And therefore, you're distributing the reads

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
to many different RDS databases.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So you can create up to 15 Read Replicas.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So as you can see, in this example,

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I have two Read Replicas on top of my main RDS database,

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and my applications can read from all of them.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Now, when it comes to writing data,

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
writing data is only done to the main database,

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
so your application still have to write

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
to the only one central RDS database, okay.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So Read Replicas are used to scale reads.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Now we have Multi-AZ.

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And so this is helpful when you have

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
to have failover in case of an AZ outage.

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So in case in the availability zone,

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
like crashes, and this gives you high availability.

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So in this example, your applications to read and write

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
from the same main RDS database, okay.

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But we are going to set up

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
a replication cross AZ,

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
so in another different availability zone.

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And this is going to be a failover database,

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and this is why it's called Multi-AZ

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
because it's in a different AZ.

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Now, in case the main RDS database crashes,

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,000
for whatever reason,

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
because maybe there's an issue with it,

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
or maybe because the AZ is having problems,

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
then RDS will trigger a failover.

45
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And then your application will failover

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
to developer database in a different AZ.

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So in this case, data is only read and written

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
to the main database.

49
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The failover DB is passive,

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
it's not accessible until there is an issue

51
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
with the main database.

52
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And you can only have one other AZ zone as a failover AZ.

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The last kind of deployment you can do

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
is called Multi Region.

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So this is for read replicas,

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
but this time, instead of being in the same region,

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
they are across different regions.

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So to take an example,

59
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
we have EU-West one for RDS database,

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and we're going to create a read replica in US-East two.

61
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And so applications in US-East two can read locally

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
from this read replica.

63
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But anytime this application needs to write data,

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
the writes need to happen across region.

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And so we need to write the data to US one.

66
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Same if you were to have also another region

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
in AP-Southeast two so in Australia,

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
you'd have the same concepts.

69
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So why would you want a multi region type of deployments?

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Well, number one,

71
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
because you want to set up a disaster recovery strategy,

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
in case of a region issue.

73
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So if EU-West one is having a regional issue,

74
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
then you have a backup in either ES-East two,

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
or AP-Southeast two,

76
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
and this is why it's a disaster recovery strategy.

77
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And also, as you can see,

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
our applications that are in different regions

79
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
get better performance, because they're read

80
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
from a local database, so they have less latency.

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But finally, when you do this,

82
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
you need to understand that

83
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
because you are replicating data across regions,

84
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
then there is going to be a replication cost associated

85
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
with a network transfers of data between regions.

86
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So that's it for RDS deployments,

87
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
the scenarios that will be proposed to you at the exam

88
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
will make it clear what department you choose.

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
