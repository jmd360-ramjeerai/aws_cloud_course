1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay, so let's summarize the section

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
on the ELB and the ASG.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So first, we discussed the concept of high availability.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Scalability would be vertical and horizontal,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
elasticity and agility in the Cloud.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It is very important for you to understand

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
to which concept corresponds to which features.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
For example, high availability

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
means that you are having your applications

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
across multiple availability zone.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Vertical scaling means that you're increasing the size

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
of an instance.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And horizontal scaling,

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
is that you are increasing the number of instances.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Elasticity is the ability to scale up and down

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
based on demand.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And agility is a concept of the Cloud that is going

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
to be able to make you work faster,

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
because you can create and delete resources

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
very, very quickly.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Now, our load balancers, or ELB,

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
are allowing us to distribute traffic

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
across backend EC2 instances, and they can be spread out

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
across multiple availability zones.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We support health checks to make sure

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
that the backend EC2 instances are indeed healthy.

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And we have four kinds of load bouncers.

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The classic one is old and retired.

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We have the application balancer for HTTP type of workload

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
at the layer seven.

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Network load balancer for very high performance

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and TCP level load balancing, layer four.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And finally, the gateway load balancer, layer three,

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
to route the network itself, and make it go by, for example,

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
through some virtual appliances.

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We have auto scaling groups that allow us

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
to implement elasticity for our application,

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
therefore spreading our load across multiple AZ

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and scaling accordingly.

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So we scale these EC2 instances

41
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
based on the demand on your system,

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and we can replace unhealthy instances.

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
There's a tight integration between the ASG and the ELB.

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So this is why they are a great combination,

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and together, we achieve high availability, scalability,

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
elasticity, and agility in the Cloud.

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
All right, that's it.

48
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
