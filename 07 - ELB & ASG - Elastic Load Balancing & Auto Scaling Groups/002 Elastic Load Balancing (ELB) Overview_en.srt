1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
So let's see, the first service

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
that will allow us to be more elastic

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
on AWS, this is called elastic load balancing.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So a load balancer is a server that will forward

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
the internet traffic down to multiple servers downstream.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And for then there will be EC2 instances.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
They're also called the backend EC2 instances.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So elastic load balancing is something

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
that is managed by AWS.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So we have a load balancer

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and this is what we will be publicly exposing for our users.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And behind that load balancer,

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
we will have multiple EC2 instances,

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
maybe three in that case.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And then we have our first user talking

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
to our load balancer, okay?

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And the load balancer will be directing the traffic

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
to one of these EC2 instances.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And the EC2 instance will reply back

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
with something and the user will get the response.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But now if a second user comes in,

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
then they will get the reply from another EC2 instance.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And if a third user comes in

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
as you can expect, it will be replying

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
from another EC2 instance.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And so the load balancer, the more users we have,

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
the more it will balance the load

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
across multiple EC2 instances

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and that will allow us to scale better our backend.

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So why would you use one?

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I think it's clear.

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You can spread the load

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
across multiple downstream instances.

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You can expose a single point of access,

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
DNS host name, for your application.

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You can seamlessly handle the failures

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
of downstream instances.

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So we do regular health checks

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
on them and if one of them is failing,

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
then the load balancer will not direct

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
traffic to that instance.

42
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So we can hide the failure

43
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
of an instance using a load balancer.

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We can also provide SSL termination,

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
so HTTPS for your websites very easily.

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And you are able to use a load balancer

47
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
across multiple availability zones

48
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
which was making your application highly available.

49
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Okay, let's keep on going.

50
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So the ELB is a manager load balancer,

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
so you don't need to be provisioning servers.

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
AWS will do it for you

53
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and AWS will guarantee that it will be working.

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
AWS will take care of all the upgrades, maintenance,

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and high availability of that elastic load balancer.

56
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And the only thing we have to do is to configure

57
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
a few things for the behavior of that load balancer.

58
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's obviously less expensive

59
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
if you want to set up your own load balancer on EC2.

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It is definitely possible, but in the end,

61
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
there will be a lot more effort on your end

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
for maintenance, integration, maintaining and taking care

63
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
of the operating system, upgrades, et cetera, et cetera.

64
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So there are four kinds of load balancers offered

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
by AWS and I need you to know the differences between them.

66
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So the first one is the application load balancer,

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
which is for HTTP or HTTPS-only traffic

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
which is called a Layer 7 type

69
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
of load balancer because it's HTTP and HTTPS.

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Next, we have the network load balancer.

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's ultra high performance.

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So look for that keyword.

73
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It allows for TCP and UDP actually.

74
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And it's Layer 4.

75
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So it's Layer 4 because it's lower level, so TCP and UDP.

76
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Then we have the gateway load balancer.

77
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's Layer 3.

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I will show you the differences in the next slide.

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And then finally, we have the classic load balancer

80
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
but it's being retired in 2023,

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
so it's not going to appear at the exam anymore I feel.

82
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But if you wanna know, it was a Layer 4

83
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
and Layer 7 type of load balancer of older generation.

84
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And it's been replaced by the ALB,

85
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
the application balancer

86
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
and the NLB, the network load balancer.

87
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So if you have a look at the differences between the ALB,

88
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
the NLB, and the gateway load balancer, also GWLB,

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
then what you'll need to look

90
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
at for the exam are these kind of keywords.

91
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So if you see HTTP, HTTPS or gRPC protocol,

92
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
it means it's Layer 7 and it's the ALB.

93
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Also, anytime you need HTTP routing features,

94
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
this will be requested.

95
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
For a static DNS as well,

96
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
this would be very helpful if you wanna have a static URL.

97
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So the architecture is very simple.

98
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The users access your load balancers

99
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
on one of the protocols I just mentioned

100
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and then the load balancer routes traffic

101
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
to the downstream EC2 instances.

102
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
For example, if you've chosen the targets

103
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
to be EC2 instances.

104
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
For the network load balancer,

105
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
it is Layer 4.

106
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So TCP and UDP protocol, and it's very high performance.

107
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
We're talking millions of requests per second.

108
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It gives you a static IP this time, so not a static URL,

109
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
but a static IP through the use of elastic IP

110
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
which are IPs that you own that you can move around.

111
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So this NLB gives you a static IP

112
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
and the architecture is the exact same as the ALB.

113
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The traffic is being sent

114
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
to the NLB on the TCP and UDP protocol, and then sent,

115
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
forwarded to downstream targets.

116
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
For example, E2 instances.

117
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Now, the gateway load balancer is using the GENEVE protocol

118
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
on the IP packets themselves.

119
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So it's Layer 3.

120
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And the use case you need to look

121
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
at for the exam is to route traffic

122
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
to firewalls that you manage on EC2 instances,

123
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
so that you can do, for example, classic firewall

124
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
or intrusion detection or deep packet inspection.

125
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And the architecture, it is a little bit more complicated.

126
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So the gateway load balancer doesn't balance

127
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
the load to your application.

128
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It actually balances the load of the traffic

129
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
to the virtual appliances that you run

130
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
on EC2 instances so that you can analyze the traffic

131
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
or perform firewall operations.

132
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That's why it's called

133
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
third-party security virtual appliances.

134
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And they can be, many of them address

135
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
represented one on this diagram.

136
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And so therefore, the traffic, when it goes

137
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
to the gateway load balancer, first sends the traffic

138
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
to these EC2 instances that will analyze the traffic.

139
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The traffic will be sent back afterwards

140
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
to the gateway load balancer

141
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
and then forwarded back to the applications.

142
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So the gateway load balancer here is

143
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
in the middle to allow us to inspect the IP packets themself

144
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and to perform firewall features

145
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
or intrusion detection or deep packet inspection.

146
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Okay, so if you understood this, you know the differences

147
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
between the load balancers and you'll be good for the exam.

148
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And I will see you in the next lecture for some practice.
