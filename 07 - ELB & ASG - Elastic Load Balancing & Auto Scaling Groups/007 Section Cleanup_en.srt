1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So, we are going to clean up our instances

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and so on, but if you try to go in instances

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and actually terminate these two instances,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
this will not work, because if you do so,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
then the auto-scaling group will recreate them.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So, the strategy here is to actually go

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
under the auto-scaling group,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and we're going to delete the auto-scaling group altogether,

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
so just type 'Delete' in here to confirm the deletion of it,

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and then the next thing we have to delete

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
is the low balancer,

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
so find your application balancer action and then delete.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Confirm to agree and you're good to go and finally,

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
you may be wondering, well,

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
should I delete my target group?

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Well, we don't have to

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
because the target group don't cost you any money

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and the target group is going to be empty

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
because we have deleted the auto-scaling group

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and we have deleted the low balancer.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
That's it.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
When the ASG is going to be gone,

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
then your EC2 instances, that's your ASG managers,

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
will also be gone, so, you'll be fully clean.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So, that's it.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We will remain within the free tier for this course.

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
