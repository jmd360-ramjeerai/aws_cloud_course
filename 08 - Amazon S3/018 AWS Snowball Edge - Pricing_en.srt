00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's talk about Snowball Edge pricing.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So you're going to pay for usage of the device,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
as well as data transfer out of AWS.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So if you take data from AWS onto your Snowball Edge

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and then you receive it, then you're going to pay for this.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
But instead, if you put data onto your Snowball Edge

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and then put that data onto Amazon S3,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
it's going to be free.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
$0 per gigabytes.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So putting data in Amazon S3 is free.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Next, for the pricing of the device itself,

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
so there's two levels.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You have on-demand,

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
where you have a one-time service fee per job,

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
so you're going to pay something,

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
but as part of the service fee,

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
you're going to get 10 days of usage

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
for the 80 terabytes Snowball Edge Storage Optimized

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
or 15 days for the 210 terabytes.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And then the shipping days are not included

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
towards the 10 or 15 days limit.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So shipping from it was to you or from you to AWS is free.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And then just days of usage is counted

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
per days after 10 or 15 days.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Next, you have committed upfront

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
where you pay in advance for monthly, one year,

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
or three years usage of the Snowball Edge device.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This is to do edge computing.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And you get up to 62% of discounted pricing

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
because you are committing upfront to a long-term usage.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So that's it.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
From an exam perspective,

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I think we need to remember

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
is that everything you have to pay for,

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
except data into Amazon S3,

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
which costs you $0 per gigabytes.

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Okay, that's it for this lecture, I hope you liked it.

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And I will see you in the next lecture.
