1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So now let's talk about the AWS Snow Family.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So this is a highly secure, portable device used

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
to collect and process data at the edge

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and migrate data in and out of AWS.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So we have two kinds.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We have the Snowcone, it's a small device,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and we have the Snowball Edge, it's a much bigger device.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So each have their own specificity.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So the Snowcone is for very small storage capacity.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You have the option between 8 to 14 terabytes,

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and usually you use the Snowcone when you have

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
a very small migration size of up to terabytes.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Snowball Edge is a much bigger device.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You have different flavors of it,

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
but the storage capacity can go, for example,

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
from 80 terabytes to 210 terabytes,

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and you want to use them when you have

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
a migration size up to petabytes,

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
where you order many, many different Snowball Edge devices.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So why do we need Snowball devices in the first place?

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Well, let's talk about data migrations.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So here is a table of how long it takes

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
to transfer 10 terabytes, or 100 terabytes, or 1 petabyte,

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
based on your connection speed.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So for example, if you want to transfer 100 terabytes

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and you have a 1 gigabit per second connection,

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
then it would take you 12 days.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So obviously this would also take you

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
all your bandwidth from your company.

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So when you have a limited connectivity or limited bandwidth

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
or your network costs can be very high,

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
or for example, you can't maximize the license

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
because you are sharing the bandwidth

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
or you have issues with connection stability,

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
then you want to use the AWS Snow Family,

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
because there are offline devices

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and they allow you to perform data migrations.

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So as a rule of thumb, if it takes you more than a week

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
to transfer data over the network,

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
then you should use Snowball devices.

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So how does that work?

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Well, this is a direct upload

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
from directly our client into Amazon S3,

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
but with the Snow Family, we order a Snowball

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
or a Snowcone device, it gets delivered to us,

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
then we load the data onto it, we ship it back to AWS,

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and AWS is going to import it directly

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
into your Amazon S3 bucket.

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So this is an offline data transfer.

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So we first request a Snowball device

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
from the AWS console for delivery.

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Then we install the Snowball clients

53
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
or something called AWS OpsHub

54
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
on their servers to transfer data.

55
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Then we connect the Snowball device to our server

56
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and we start copying files using the clients,

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and then we ship back the device when we're ready.

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It goes directly into an AWS facility.

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The data is going to be loaded onto an Amazon S3 bucket,

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and then your Snowball is completely wiped

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and can be sent to another customer.

62
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So this is for the data migration process,

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
but you also have edge computing.

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So what is edge computing?

65
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Well, this is to process data created on the edge location.

66
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That means it could be a truck on the road

67
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
or a ship on the sea or a mining station on the ground.

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And these locations they may have limited or no internet,

69
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
and they may have no access to computing power.

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So here again, we order a Snowball Edge device

71
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
or a Snowcone device, and then we do edge computing.

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Snowcone comes with a very, very simple CPU

73
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and very low memory,

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
but it still can be helpful for some use cases.

75
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And then on Snowball Edge,

76
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
you have this compute optimized instance,

77
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
which is dedicated for that use case,

78
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
which has a lot of processing power,

79
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
or the storage optimized also has some processing power.

80
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And when you have a Snowball Edge, for example, device,

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
you can run EC2 instances or Lambda functions directly

82
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
on your Snowball Edge device directly at the edge.

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So, the use cases for edge computing

84
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
is to pre-process data where it's created,

85
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
or to do machine learning, again on data where it's created

86
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
or to transcode media while it's being shipped back to AWS.

87
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So let's see, we've seen Snowcone and Snowball Edge devices.

88
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
They're used for data migration and edge computing.

89
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
