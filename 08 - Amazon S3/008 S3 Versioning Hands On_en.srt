1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So now let's play with S3 versioning.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And so first you need to go into the properties

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and then we have a bucket versioning setting.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We're going to edit this and we're going to enable it.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And this is to enable bucket versioning.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And therefore any files we override now

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
is just going to add versions into our buckets.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So this is good.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let's go into our objects

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and say we want to update our website.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So let's go back, find the website URL.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It is right here.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Okay, so we have "I love coffee"

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
but let's say we want to write, "I really love coffee"

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
so therefore let's go back into here, our file.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And I'm going to edit it

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and say I really love coffee.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I've saved it.

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And now I upload this file again.

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So I'm going to add a file and it will be my index.html.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And now we have updated content in that file.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So if I upload it.

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's successful.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So now it's been overwritten.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
If I go into my first webpage and refresh this,

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I get "I REALLY love coffee."

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But what did happen in the back?

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Well, if we go here

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and we have here this toggle "Show versions"

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
we're going to show the actual version ID with the files.

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And so we can notice a few things.

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Number one, the files that we had uploaded before

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
such as the beach.jpg and the coffee.jpg

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
have a null version id.

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That's because they were uploaded

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
before we had enabled versioning.

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But this file index.html as you can see has two versions.

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
One has version ID null, which is the file we had uploaded

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
before enabling versioning.

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
But the file we uploaded just right now has a version ID.

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And therefore, by updating this file

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and uploading it into our S3 bucket,

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
we have created a new version ID.

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So this is something you can only see if you

45
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
enable this toggle.

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So now thanks to versioning

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
what we can do is we can actually roll-back our page.

48
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So we have, "I REALLY love coffee"

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
but we wanna go back to "I love coffee."

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So how do we do this while we click on

51
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
this specific version ID

52
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Okay, so make sure that "Show versions" is enabled

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and then we're going to delete.

54
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And here we have to delete a specific version ID

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
of our object.

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And therefore when we delete a specific version ID

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
of our object, it's called a permanent delete.

58
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So it's a destructive operation, it cannot be undone.

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And so if we're sure, we type permanently delete

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
in this text box and click on delete objects.

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And now if you go back, as we can see,

62
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
we are back with the previous date of our bucket.

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And therefore if I refresh this page,

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I just get "I love coffee."

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But what if we disable "Show versions"?

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So now we just have our objects

67
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and I'm going to take this coffee.jpg file,

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and I will delete it itself.

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So this time we don't actually delete

70
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
the underlying version ID,

71
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
we delete by adding a delete marker.

72
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And so it doesn't actually delete the underlying object

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
as we'll see.

74
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Let's just type delete this time.

75
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's not permanently delete, it's just delete

76
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and we delete the object.

77
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Perfect.

78
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So now if we have a look at it from within our bucket,

79
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
it looks like the coffee.jpg file is done.

80
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But if we click on "Show versions"

81
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
we see that we have a delete marker on our coffee.jpg file

82
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
with this version ID.

83
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And the real, the previous, at least, coffee.jpg file

84
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
is still in our buckets

85
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
but it's being overwritten at least right now

86
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
from a version perspective by a delete marker.

87
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So back into our webpage, if I refresh this page

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and I refresh it by forcing a refresh,

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
by doing a Command + Shift + R to force a refresh

90
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
then we see that the image is not available.

91
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So how do we get back this image?

92
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And if I just try to, for example,

93
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
open this image in the new tab, it doesn't work.

94
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I get a "404 Not Found."

95
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So instead to get back the previous objects

96
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I can click on this delete marker

97
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
and I'm going to delete the delete marker.

98
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So I will permanently delete this delete marker.

99
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And the effect of that is that it will restore

100
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
the previous version of my object

101
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
which is this one from before.

102
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So back into my webpage, if I refresh it now

103
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
we can see that the coffee.jpg file is there.

104
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So you can play around with versioning

105
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
you can add as many file version as you want.

106
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You can start deleting them and view what happens.

107
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But I hope you like this lecture

108
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and I will see you in the next lecture.
