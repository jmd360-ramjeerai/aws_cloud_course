1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now let's talk about Amazon S3 Replication,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
and there are two flavors of it.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So CRR is for cross-region replication

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and SRR is for same-region replication.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The idea is that we have an S3 Bucket in one region

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and a target S3 Bucket in another region,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and we want to set up asynchronous replication

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
between these two buckets.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So, to do so, we first must enable Versioning

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
in the source and the destination buckets.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And if we do CRR, so cross-region replication,

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
the two regions must be different.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
If we do SRR, the two regions are the same.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Now, it's possible for you to have these buckets

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
in different AWS accounts

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and copying happens asynchronously.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So the replication mechanism happens behind the scenes,

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
in the background.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And to make replication work,

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
you must give proper IAM permissions

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
to the S3 service so that it has the permission

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
to read and write from specified buckets.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So the use cases for replication are manyfold.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The first one is that if you use cross-region replication,

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
this can be helpful for compliance

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
or for providing lower latency access to your data

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
because it's in another region,

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
or to replicate data across accounts.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
For SRR, or same-region replication,

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
this can be very helpful to aggregate logs

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
across multiple S3 Buckets

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
or to perform a live replication

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
between a production and test accounts,

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
so, you have your own test environment.

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Okay, so that's it about replication.

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I will see you in the next lecture for some practice.
