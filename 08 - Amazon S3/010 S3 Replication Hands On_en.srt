1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
So let's practice replication

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
on Amazon S3.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
For this, we're going to create a new bucket.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'll call it S3 Stephane bucket origin V2,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and I will set it in one region that I want,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
for example, EU west one.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This will be my origin buckets

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and then data will be replicated

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
from this bucket to another bucket.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So the thing I need to do of course,

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
is to enable versioning

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
because replication only works

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
if versioning is enabled.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So I will create this bucket,

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and then open this bucket in a new tab

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and I will create a second bucket

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and this will be my target bucket.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So I will do S3 Stephane bucket replica V2.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And this time, the region can be either the same,

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
for example, if you wanted to do same region replication

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
or something completely different,

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
for example if you wanted the US,

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
you could do US east one

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
to replicate from Europe to the US.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Okay, so let's scroll down

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and let's again, enable bucket versioning

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
on the target buckets.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And we're good to go.

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So now we have our primary buckets

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and our secondary buckets.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
What I'm going to do is that in the origin bucket,

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm going to upload a file

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
so I will add a file of my beach,

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
for example, beach.jpeg.

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Okay, this is done and we can close this.

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So now this has one file,

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
but of course, this does not get replicated yet

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
because we haven't set up replication yet

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
so let's go ahead and do this.

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So on the origin bucket,

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
what I need to do is to go under management,

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
scroll down and there are replication rules,

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
currently, zero.

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So let's go ahead and create our first replication rule.

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So I'll call this one demo replication rule.

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Okay, perfect.

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We'll set it as enabled.

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
For the source bucket,

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
we'll leave it as is

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and in terms of rule scope,

51
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
we'll apply it to all objects in the buckets.

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Now for the destination,

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
we can specify a bucket in this account

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
or in other accounts,

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and we'll choose one in this account

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
and the bucket name is my target bucket.

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So I need to actually enter the name.

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So I'll take this bucket right here, copy and paste it.

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Okay, and as you can see,

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
the destination region was identified

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
as being US east one,

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
so therefore, this is a cross region replication.

63
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Okay, now for IAM role,

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
we need to actually go

65
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and create a new role for this.

66
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So there's the option.

67
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And then we can have a look at some settings,

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
but for now, it doesn't really matter for us.

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Let's just save this.

70
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So we get a prompt right here,

71
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
which says, do you want to replicate existing objects?

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So it turns out that when you do enable replication,

73
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
it will only replicate objects

74
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
from the moment you set it,

75
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
so for newer uploads.

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So if you wanted to replicate the previous objects

77
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
from the source of the destination bucket,

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
you could use something called a batch operation,

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
an S3 batch operation to do so

80
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
and you would need to say yes, replicate existing objects,

81
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
but this is separate from the replication feature itself.

82
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Therefore, I'm going to say no,

83
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
do not replicate existing objects

84
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
and we're good to go.

85
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So now let's have a look.

86
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So we have this management

87
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
with a replication rule that is ready.

88
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And now what I'm going to do is check in my replica bucket.

89
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Of course, if I refresh now,

90
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
we see that the objects haven't been replicated.

91
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So I'm going to do is now upload a new file,

92
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
for example, upload the coffee.jpeg file,

93
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
upload it.

94
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
We're done.

95
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So here is the coffee.jpeg file.

96
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Let's show the version.

97
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So this is coffee.jpeg and the version is GBK.

98
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Okay, perfect.

99
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Now, if we go in my target bucket and refresh this,

100
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
it's gonna take maybe five seconds.

101
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And this took about 10 seconds on the first replication,

102
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
but we can see that my coffee.jpeg

103
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
has been added into my replica bucket.

104
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And if I show the versions,

105
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
we can see the version ID

106
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
of my coffee.jpeg is the exact same of the origin bucket.

107
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So the versions IDs are replicated, which is great.

108
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And if I wanted to port the beach.jpeg,

109
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I would need to upload a new version of that file,

110
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
so let's upload beach.jpeg again.

111
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Now this has been uploaded.

112
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
We can look at the version.

113
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So there is a new version right here

114
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
of DK2, of my beach.jpeg file.

115
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And now if I go here and refresh,

116
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
and this took a bit of time, but as you can see,

117
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
you can find the DK2 version of that file.

118
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So that's it for S3 bucket replication.

119
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I hope you liked it

120
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
and I will see you in the next lecture.
