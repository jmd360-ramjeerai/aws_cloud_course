1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
So let's create a new bucket industry

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
and call it "s3-storage-classes-demos-2022."

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Okay. Then I create into any kinda region,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and I will go ahead and just create this bucket.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So back in my bucket, I can go ahead

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and upload a object, and click on add files.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I will choose my coffee.JPEG.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And let's have a look at the options.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So we can look at the properties

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
of that object,

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and under storage class, I get the wide range

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
of storage class that are for AWS objects.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So we have S3 standard, okay,

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and we get the design four column.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
How many AZ's we have,

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
as well as some other (indistinct)

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
the minimum storage duration,

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
minimum billable object size,

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and monitoring and auto-tiering fees.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So let's have a look at all of them.

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So we have standard, which is the basic ones by default.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Then we get intelligent tiering,

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
in case we don't know our data patterns,

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and therefore we want AWS

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
to perform the data tiering for us.

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Standard-IA, if we want data to be infrequently accessed,

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
but still with low latency.

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
One-Zone-IA,

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
which is that you can recreate this data,

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and it's going to be stored in one AZ only.

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And therefore you can

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
run the risk of losing the object,

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
if the AZ is destroyed.

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Then we have three glacier levels.

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So we have Glacier Instant Retrieval,

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Glacier Flexible Retrieval,

37
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
or a Glacier Deep Archive,

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and it tells you exactly

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
what are the conditions in here.

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And finally, Reduced Redundancy,

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
which is a deprecated type of storage tier,

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and therefore I did not describe it in the course.

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So what if we go with standard IA

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
for example, and create an object there.

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So we're going there,

46
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and then we're going to say upload.

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Back in our bucket.

48
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So now this object has the storage class, Standard-IA,

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
as it is shown here.

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But what I can do is

51
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
that I can also change the storage class

52
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
if I wanted to.

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So I can go into properties and scroll down,

54
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and we can actually edit the storage class

55
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
to do something different.

56
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So we can move it for example,

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
to One-Zone-IA,

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
in which case this object is going

59
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
to be stored in one zone only.

60
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So let's save these changes.

61
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And now my object has successfully been edited

62
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and therefore the object class has changed.

63
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So if we scroll down, now we are in One-Zone-IA.

64
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And again, you could edit it,

65
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
and go, for example, for Glacier-Instant-Retrieval.

66
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And now it's going to be archived,

67
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
or you can go for Intelligent-Tiering,

68
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and it could be automatically set

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
to the right tier based on our patterns, and so on.

70
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So you can see there's a lot of power using storage classes.

71
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And finally,

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I want to show you how we can automate moving these objects

73
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
between the different storage classes.

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So let's go back

75
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
into our buckets, and there under management,

76
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
you can create lifecycle rules.

77
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And you can create a rule,

78
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and we'll call this one "DemoRule."

79
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And then you're going to say,

80
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
"hey," apply to all objects in the buckets.

81
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yeah, sure.

82
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And then we can say, okay

83
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
move current versions between storage classes.

84
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And you're saying, hey, you go

85
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
to Standard-IA after, for example, 30 days.

86
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And then you go to Intelligent-Tiering after 60 days.

87
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And then you would go to Glacier-Flexible-Retrieval

88
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
after 180 days,

89
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
and so on.

90
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So you get some transitions.

91
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And in here you can review

92
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
all the transitions you have done.

93
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So it is possible

94
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
for you to automate moving objects between tiers.

95
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Okay. So that's it,

96
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
we've seen everything we need to know about storage classes.

97
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I hope you liked it.

98
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And I will see you in the next lecture.
