1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay, so let's enable our bucket

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
to be a website.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
But first, I'm going to upload one more file here,

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm going to upload my beach.jpg file into our buckets.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Okay, this is done, so we have two files into our buckets,

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and let's go into Properties, scroll down,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and all the way down

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
you will find the static website hosting.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So click on Edit,

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and here we will enable static website hosting.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We want to host a static website

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and we need to specify an index document.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So I will say, index.html

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and we will have to upload that file.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This is the default or homepage of the websites.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
As you can see here, we also have a little warning sign

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
saying, hey, by the way

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
if you want to enable this as a website endpoint

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
you must make all your content publicly readable.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And we've done this in the previous lecture, so that's good.

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Okay, so let's go and save this.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So this is saved, and go back into our objects.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And the one thing that's missing here

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
is that index, that HTML file.

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So let's go to upload this,

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
we Add files and then I will click on index.html

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and then upload, close it.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's created, so now back into Properties,

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
let's scroll all the way down,

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and you see now that's under static website hosting,

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
we have a bucket website endpoint.

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So I copy this URL, paste it,

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and I get, I love coffee.

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Hello world!

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And my coffee.jpg file.

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So this working, so this is my index at HTML file,

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and if I right click on this and open this image in new tab,

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
we have the public URL of our coffee.jpg.

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So this is working,

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and by the way if you wanted to change the coffee for beach,

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
well under beach.jpg we can see as well

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
this beach image right here.

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So that means that everything is working,

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
our S3 bucket is enabled for static website hosting,

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and thanks to the S3 bucket policy being public,

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
we can see all these files.

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So we're good to go, I hope you like this lecture

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and I will see you in the next lecture.
