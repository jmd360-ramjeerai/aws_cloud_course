1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
So we've seen Amazon S3

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
as a standalone service, but it is possible for you

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
to use it in a hybrid cloud type of setting.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So AWS wants you to bridge

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
between your on-premises environment to AWS

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and that's called a hybrid cloud.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So part of your infrastructure is going to be on-premises

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and the rest is going to be on the cloud.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Why?

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Well, maybe because sometimes you have created,

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
for example, your on-premises infrastructure first

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and you're doing a migration but it could be long

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
so you can do a long cloud migration

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
or for security requirements or compliance requirements,

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
maybe it's your strategy to have part of it on the cloud

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and part of it on-premises.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You have really different use cases

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
for trying to have two different ways of doing IT.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Some of it on-premises and some of it on the cloud.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And Amazon S3, it's a proprietary storage technology,

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
so this is not something like the EFS service

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
or NFS protocol we saw from before

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
that we can use directly on two servers on-premises.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
For exposing S3 data on-premises,

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
you have to use something called a Storage Gateway.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So if you wanted to summarize the storage options on AWS,

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
the block storage would be EBS

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
or an EC2 instance store.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The file storage would be a network file system

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
so Amazon EFS,

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and object storage would be Amazon S3 or Glacier.

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And where does the Storage Gateway fit in all this?

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Well, the Storage Gateway is going to be bridging

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
your on-premises data and cloud data in AWS.

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So your hybrid storage will allow your on-premises systems

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
to seamlessly use the cloud

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
to extend the storage capability.

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So this can be used for disaster recovery,

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
backup and restore or tiered storage.

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
There are different types of Storage Gateway.

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
There is a File Gateway, there is a Volume Gateway

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and a Tape Gateway.

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Now you don't need to know all these types

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
going into the exam, okay?

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What you need to know is that the Storage Gateway

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
allows you to bridge whatever happens on-premises

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
directly into the AWS Cloud.

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So under the scene,

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
the Storage Gateway will be using Amazon EBS,

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Amazon S3, and Glacier behind the scenes, okay?

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So from a certified cloud petitioner perspective,

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
the Storage Gateway is a way for you

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
to bridge your file systems and your storage on-premises

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
into the cloud to leverage best of both worlds, okay?

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
For if you were to do

56
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate course,

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
you would need to understand Storage Gateway

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
a little bit better, but I will save you this right now

59
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
for the Certified Cloud Practitioner.

60
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Okay, that's it.

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I hope you liked it

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
and I will see you in the next lecture.
