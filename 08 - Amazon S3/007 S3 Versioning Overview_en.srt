1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
So, now let's talk about versioning

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
in Amazon S3.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Because we've seen how to create a website,

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
but it would be nice to be able to update it in a safe way.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So, you can version your files in Amazon S3,

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and this is a setting you have to enable

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
at the bucket level.

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So, we have my bucket and it's enabled with versioning.

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So, whenever a user uploads a file,

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
it's going to create a version of that file

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
at the selected key.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And then should we re-upload the same key,

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
should we overwrite that file,

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
then instead it's going to create a version two,

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and then a version three, and so on.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So, therefore, it is best practice to version your buckets.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Why?

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Well, the first thing is that it protects

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
against unintended deletes.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So, for example, if you delete a file version,

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
actually you just add a delete marker

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and therefore you can restore versions

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
that were previously there instead.

24
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You can also easily roll back to a previous version.

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So, if you want to go back to what happened two days ago,

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
you can take a file and roll it back.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So, there are some notes you need to be aware of.

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
First of all, that any file that is not versioned

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
prior to enabling versioning will have the version null.

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And also that if you suspend versioning,

31
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
it does not delete the previous version,

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
so, it's a safe operation.

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Okay, so now let's go into the console

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and have a look at how we can use versioning.
