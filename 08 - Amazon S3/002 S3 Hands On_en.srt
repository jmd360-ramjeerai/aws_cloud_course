1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So here I am in Amazon S3,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and I'm going to go ahead and create a bucket.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now you will notice here that there's a region selected,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
which is Europe, Stockholm, eu-north-1.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And this is because I have the region selection in here.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So choose the region you want to create your bucket in,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and we'll see that Amazon S3 still has a view

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
over all your buckets across all regions.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Now there's a bucket type that you may or may not see.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So if you're in some regions where it's available,

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
you will see general purpose or directory new.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And over time, it will be in more regions.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
If you don't see it in your region, this is fine.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The option you should choose

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
if you see it is general purpose.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And if you don't see this option,

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
it will be automatically general purpose.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So don't touch anything

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and don't feel alarmed if you don't see these options.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Directory buckets are for a specific type of use case

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
that is not covered at the exam,

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
so I will not be talking about it.

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So if you see the screen, choose general purpose.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
If you don't see the screen,

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
everything is fine, do not worry.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Okay, so you choose a region,

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and next you need to choose a bucket name.

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And so if you enter a bucket name that is already taken,

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
for example, tests,

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and you try all the way down to create your bucket,

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
you're going to get an error saying

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
that the bucket with the same name already exists.

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So your bucket name must be unique across all regions

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and all accounts ever created in AWS.

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This is why I name my buckets

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
with something very, very personal.

37
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
For example, it could be Stephane and then demo, S3,

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and I usually add version number, v5,

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
because I've been creating this video many, many times over

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
as the interface changes.

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So, stephane-demo-s3-v5 should be available,

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and they should have no errors.

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
But if someone already took it,

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
then I will need to change the name.

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Okay, so next for object ownership.

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Right now you have ACL disabled.

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This is recommended.

48
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
This is a security setting.

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Don't worry about it. We'll leave it as a default.

50
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Now for blocking public access to this bucket,

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
again, we'll leave this enabled.

52
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So we'll block all public access,

53
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and we want to have maximum security in our bucket,

54
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
so only us can upload files to it.

55
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Next for bucket versioning.

56
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So we want to disable bucket versioning right now,

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and we'll see later on how to enable it.

58
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
No tags are needed.

59
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And for default encryption,

60
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm going to use server-side encryption

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
with Amazon S3 managed key.

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So all my objects are going to be encrypted,

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and I will choose the first option.

64
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We'll talk about encryption later on.

65
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And bucket key, I will enable it.

66
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So we'll leave, as you can see, all the settings as default.

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The only thing we have set, really, is the bucket name.

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So I'll go ahead and create my bucket.

69
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And now it has been successfully created.

70
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And you will see here in this UI all your buckets.

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
If you have directory enabled,

72
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
you will see also directory buckets,

73
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
right now I have none.

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But your general purpose buckets are here.

75
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Right now, you should see one bucket

76
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
if you just created this course.

77
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,000
For me, I have 33

78
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
because I've been using my account quite a lot.

79
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And this will deploy buckets for all AWS regions,

80
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
not just the one you're in right now, but all regions.

81
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
As you can see, I have Ireland, London.

82
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I scroll down, I get us-east-1, Frankfurt, and so on.

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So all your buckets are going to be displayed here,

84
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and you can do a little search.

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
For example, stephane-demo,

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
and here is my bucket.

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So I'm going to click on it and have a look at it inside.

88
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And now in my bucket,

89
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I would like to start uploading objects

90
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
because currently you have zero objects.

91
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So let's click on upload, and then we can add files.

92
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And navigate into your code, go into the S3 folder,

93
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and then you will find a coffee.jpg file.

94
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So choose this coffee.jpg file.

95
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
As you can see, it's an image jpg,

96
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
it has 100 kilobytes in size.

97
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And then the destination is S3 stephane demo,

98
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
which is my bucket.

99
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Okay, so let's upload this file.

100
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
We're done.

101
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So I can close this on the right-hand side.

102
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And now back into my S3 bucket.

103
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I can see the coffee.jpg file is under my objects.

104
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So I can do is now click on it

105
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
and have more details around that file.

106
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So now that we are in the object page,

107
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
we can have a look at a bunch of overviews.

108
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So a bunch of properties where it's been uploaded, the size,

109
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
the type, and there's an object URL here.

110
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
We'll be playing it in a moment.

111
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So how do we do this?

112
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So now we want to open this object

113
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
and see if we can open it.

114
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
We can view it because we have uploaded it

115
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
onto our Amazon S3 buckets.

116
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Therefore, I'm going to click on open.

117
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And if I do click on open, as you can see,

118
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I can see my coffee.jpg file.

119
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So this is the one I have uploaded,

120
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and it is on the internet.

121
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Awesome, right?

122
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But if I go back to my overview

123
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
and click on this object url over here.

124
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So I copy it, I paste it, and I enter it.

125
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
As you can see, I get an access denied.

126
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And this access denied

127
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
tells me that I cannot access my object

128
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
using what's called the public URL.

129
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So you can see here, this public URL is not working,

130
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
but this URL is working.

131
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So what's the difference?

132
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Well, this URL right here,

133
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
if you have a look at it, the beginning is exactly the same,

134
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
but then the rest is a very, very complicated and long URL,

135
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
because it's called an S3 pre-signed URL.

136
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Why?

137
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Well, because this URL contains actually a signature

138
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
that verifies that I am the one making the request,

139
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
and therefore it has my credentials in it.

140
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And so because my credentials are encoded in this URL,

141
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
then Amazon S3 says,

142
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
"Well, Stephane is allowed to view his own object,

143
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
therefore I will display it."

144
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So this public URL does not work,

145
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
but this pre-signed URL with my own credentials works,

146
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
and of course, this URL is only for me.

147
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So we'll see how to make that object public later on,

148
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
so that the public URL will function as well.

149
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So let's go back into our bucket, the stephane-demo-s3.

150
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And I have one object, but I can create a folder.

151
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And this folder name may be called images.

152
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So we scroll down and create this folder.

153
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So now I have the images folder in my bucket.

154
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I can click on it,

155
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
and within it, I can upload again a file.

156
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And this time, I will upload the beach.jpg file into,

157
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
as you can see, the destination is my images folder

158
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
within my S3 buckets.

159
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So let's upload this.

160
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Close this.

161
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
As we can see now, we have the beach.jpg object

162
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
within the images folder.

163
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And if I go one level up, we can see the folder here.

164
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So this looks just like,

165
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
you know, the cloud storage service you used to know

166
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
such as Google Drive or Dropbox,

167
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
or whatever you want.

168
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Here, we have something very similar

169
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
in terms of the user experience on Amazon S3.

170
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So, of course, I can go to images

171
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
and I can delete this folder entirely.

172
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So this will delete everything within the folder.

173
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And to delete things,

174
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I just type permanently delete into the text inputs,

175
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
delete my objects, and I'm good to go.

176
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So that's it for this lecture.

177
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
We've seen how we can upload objects into Amazon S3.
