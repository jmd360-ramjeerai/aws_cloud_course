1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
So now let's summarize

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
what we've learned about Amazon S3.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And I know that's a lot.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So first of all, we've learned

5
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
about the difference between Buckets and Objects.

6
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So we know that Buckets must have a global unique name,

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and is tied to a specific region

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and Objects live within these Buckets.

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
For S3 security, we've seen that we can attach IAM policies

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
to users or to roles.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We've seen that we can also use S3 Bucket Policies.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
For example, we granted public access

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
into an S3 Bucket, and we can set

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
up S3 Encryption to protect some files.

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We can enable websites on an S3 bucket.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
This is the idea to host a static website on Amazon S3.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You first need to make sure

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
that the Bucket, of course, is going to be public.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And then we can statically host some files.

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We have S3 Versioning.

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This is to have multiple versions for a file to prevent

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
against accidental deletes and to be able to roll

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
back to previous versions if we need to.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We've seen there are two kinds of S3 Replication.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You have the same-region replication

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and the cross-region replication.

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And for them to work, you must enable versioning beforehand.

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We've seen different S3 storage classes.

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We have standard, infrequent access,

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
one zone infrequent access, intelligent tiering

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and we have three different classes for the Glacier

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
for (indistinct) purposes.

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We've seen what the Snow Family is.

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So there are physical devices that are used

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
to import data onto Amazon S3.

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So you have like the Snowmobile, you have the Snowcone,

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
you have the Snowballs and so on.

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And if you use a Snowcone or a Snowball edge device

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
then you can do edge computing on your data.

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
OpsHubs is a way to get a desktop application

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
to manage your Snow Family devices and add data onto them.

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And finally, we've seen a way to extend on-premises storage

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
onto Amazon S3, that is using the AWS storage gateway.

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So not so big lessons

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
but hopefully now you know all the specificity

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
of Amazon S3 that will allow you to answer all

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
the questions you need at the exam.

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That's it.

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I will see you in the next section.
