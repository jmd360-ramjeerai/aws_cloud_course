1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So let's go ahead and make a bucket policy

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
so that we can access this coffee file from the public URL.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So to do so, let's go under the Permission tabs.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And the first thing we have to do is

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
to allow public access from the bucket setting,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
because right now everything is blocked.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So we edit this and we're going to untick this,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and, therefore, we will allow public access.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
But again, this is something you would disable

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
only, and only if, you know you want

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
to set a public bucket policy.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So this is dangerous action.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So we say yes, because, of course, if you set real data

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
of your company on an S3 bucket and you make this public,

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
you have data leaks and that can never be good.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So now, under Permissions overview,

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
the access that objects can be public.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So that's the first step.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Next, we scroll down and we look at Bucket policy.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So currently we have none and we wanna create one

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
so that we make our entire bucket public.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So the first thing you can do is look

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
at the policies example, and this is the documentation,

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and it will show you a lot

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
of use cases on the right hand side

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
that will show you what's the appropriate

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and corresponding bucket policy.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But for us, we're going to use the policy generator.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So here's the AWS Policy Generator,

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and we're going to create an S3 Bucket Policy.

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So let's select the right type.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We'll allow, and then the principal is going to be a star

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
because we want to allow anyone

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
on the Amazon S3 service to perform,

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and because we will read objects on our bucket,

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
we want to perform a getObject.

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So here it is.

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We want to allow getObjects.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And the Amazon Resource Name must be the bucket name

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
with a slash, and then with a star.

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So let's have a look first.

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So back into our S3 buckets, we have the bucket arn here,

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
the Amazon resource name here.

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So we copy it, we paste it into the Amazon Resource Name,

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and this is not over.

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We add a slash and then we add a star.

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And the reason why we do this is that this action,

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
the getObject action right here,

49
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
applies to objects within your buckets,

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and, therefore, objects within your bucket

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
are after a slash and there are stars

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
to represent these objects.

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So let's add these statements

54
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and then let's generate this policy.

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And this policy is what we copy into here,

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and this is a public S3 policy.

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So that means that getObjects are allowed from anyone

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
on any objects of this bucket.

59
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Okay, that's good.

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So let's save these changes.

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And there is a space here, so let's remove this.

62
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Perfect.

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Save these changes.

64
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Now that works.

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So we can see that our bucket policy

66
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
has properly been applied.

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So, now, let's go into our object, coffee.jpg,

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and let's find the object URL, right here.

69
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We copy it and we enter it.

70
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And as you can see now, my coffee image is fully visible

71
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
and it is public as well as any other objects

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
in my Amazon S3 buckets.

73
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So that's it for this lecture.

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We've seen bucket policies, we've seen the policy generator,

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
and we've seen that now our image is public.

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So I hope you liked it,

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
and I will see you in the next lecture.
