1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So let's have a look at the AWS

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Snow Family Service.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So from the console you can actually order

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
a Snow family device and you have to name your job,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
for example, demo job.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So we need to choose a job type, so we can import data

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
into Amazon S3, which is the most common use case.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We can also export data from Amazon S3.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You can order a Snow device just for local compute

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and storage only.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This gives you some kind of device

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
that server that can runs in a remote place

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
without being connected to the internet.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Or you can import virtual tapes

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
into the AWS storage gateway.

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So we'll choose the first option, import into Amazon S3

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and here we have several options for Snow devices.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So we have Snowcone, Snowcone SSD,

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Snowball Edge Storage Optimized with 80 terabytes.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And then we have the compute optimized

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and the compute optimized with GPUs.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So it's possible that AWS will add options over time

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and may not rerecord this video.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So, that's fine.

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I always cover what's at the exam, so, don't worry.

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And so, as you can see, we have several options

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and we seen the previous lecture,

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
the use case for each option

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
so, I won't go over them.

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
But this is a nice way to know where you're getting.

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Okay, so let's say we go, for example

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
with a compute optimized Snowball Edge.

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Then we need to choose a pricing option.

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So we have on demand pricing, monthly pricing

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
or then commitment for one or three year period.

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Then we have the storage types.

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So it's an S3 data transfer

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and then what AMI do we want to use on it?

39
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So, this is a compute type of instance.

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So we can actually load an AMI for example

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
this Amazon Linux 2 first, no family,

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
but you could create your own AMI to have your own

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
compute needs.

44
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Then where do you want to load the data onto?

45
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So, what S3 buckets are available to you?

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I have this one right here

47
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
but you can create your own S3 buckets.

48
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Next, we have several features and options we can use.

49
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So we have IoT Greengrass for Snow to have IoT capability

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
on your Snow device, but it's not needed.

51
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And then we can do remote device management

52
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
by using OpsHub or the Snowball Clients.

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So I'll click on next

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
then what type of encryption do we want

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
on our Snowball device.

56
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So, we have this encryption key right here where

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
you can create your own KMS key and encrypt it with that.

58
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Then you need to grant access of course to Amazon S3 and SNS

59
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
to publish actions and to send data.

60
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So you need to create a service role.

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And then you need to add an address

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
so where you want to ship it, which country, which states

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and so on, as well as the shipping speed

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and the SNS notification for your job status changes.

65
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And then you'll get the job summary.

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So that's it, you've seen all the options for Snow devices

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
and the Snow family.

68
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Remember, it's most commonly used to send data

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
into Amazon S3 and out of Amazon S3.

70
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And this gives you remote compute capabilities.

71
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We've seen also the different kind of devices

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
which are Snowcone, Snowball, and Snowmobile.

73
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
All right, that's it.

74
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
