1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
As always, it's good to see

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
what is the shared responsibility model for Amazon S3.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So AWS is going to be responsible

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
for all the infrastructure.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That includes all the things specific to S3

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
so that their ability, availability,

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
the fact that it can actually sustain

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
current losses of two facilities.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
As well as, I will see their own internal configuration

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and vulnerability analysis.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And their own compliance validation

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
internally within their infrastructure.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And you as a user of Amazon S3,

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
you're supposed to set up correctly S3 Versioning

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
to make sure you set up the right S3 Bucket Policy

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
so that the data is protected within your buckets.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You need to make sure that if you want verification

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
you set it up yourself.

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Logging and monitoring is optional

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
so you have to enable it yourself.

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Making sure that you are using the most optimal

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
cost storage cloud that is going to be

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
the most cost friendly is also your responsibility.

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And finally, if you wanted to encrypt your data

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
onto your Amazon S3 bucket,

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
that is up to you as well, okay?

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So here we can really see what is the difference

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
between the responsibility of

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
AWS and yourself in this Amazon S3 service.

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
All right, that's it.

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I will see you in the next lecture.
