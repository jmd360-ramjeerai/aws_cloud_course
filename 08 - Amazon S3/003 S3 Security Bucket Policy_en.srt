1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So now let's talk about Amazon S3-Security.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The first part is User-Based.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So as a user you can have IAM policies that you

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and this IAM policy is going to authorize

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
which API calls should be allowed for a specific IAM user.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You can also have Resource-Based Security.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So this is new.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We can use what's called S3 Bucket policies

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and there are bucket wide rules

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
that you can assign directly from the S3 console.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And this will allow, for example, a specific user to come in

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
or allow a user from another account,

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
this is called cross-account

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
to access your S3 Buckets.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This is also how we'll make our S3 Buckets public

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
as I will show you in a minute.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Next, you have the Object Access Control List or ACL,

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
they're finer grain security and they can be disabled.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And if you need to go

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
at the Bucket level, you can have Buckets ACL

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
which is way less common also can be disabled.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And the most common way now to do security

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
on an Amazon S3 Bucket is to use Bucket policies.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So in which situation can an IAM principle

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
can access an S3 object?

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Well, if the IAM permissions allow it

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
or if the resource policies allows it

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and that there is no explicit deny in the action,

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
then the IAM principle can access the S3 object

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
on the specified API call.

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So we'll have a look at these use cases in a minute.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Finally, another way to do security on Amazon S3

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
is to encrypt the objects using encryption keys.

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So what does S3 Bucket policy actually look like?

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Because this is the focus of S3-Security for us.

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So they are JSON based policies and they look like this.

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So this is JSON documents and it's quite easy to read.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So the first thing is that you have a resource block

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and the resource tells the policy

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
what buckets and object this policy applies on.

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And in here we can see that this applies to every object

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
within the example Bucket,

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
this is what the star is for.

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Next we have the effect.

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So Allow or Deny, and what do we Allow or Deny?

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Well, we Deny actions.

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So we have a set of APIs we can either Allow or Deny

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
and in this example, the action we Allow is GetObject.

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So this allows anyone thanks to the principle,

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
the principle presents the account or the user

51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
to apply the policy to so principle is star.

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So, here we allow anyone with a star to GetObject,

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
so to retrieve an object from my example Bucket

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
with a start, that means any object within it.

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So therefore this S3 Bucket, is setting public reads

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
on all objects inside my Buckets.

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So we can use an S3 Bucket policy

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
to grant public access to the Bucket

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
as the one shown on the right hand side

60
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
or to force objects to be encrypted at upload

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
or to grant access to another account.

62
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So let's have a look at the situation.

63
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So here is a Bucket Policy for Public Access.

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So we have a user, it's on the worldwide web

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
it's a website visitor

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
and he wants to access files within our S3 Buckets.

67
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So we'll attach an S3 Bucket policy

68
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
that allows public access.

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
This is the one you've seen in the previous slide.

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And once this Bucket policy is attached to the S3 Bucket

71
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
then we can access any objects within it.

72
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
That's what we'll see in the hands-on.

73
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But another way to do it

74
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
is that if you have a user within your account,

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
so it's an IAM user

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
and that user wants to access Amazon S3,

77
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
then we can assign IAM permissions

78
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
to that user through a policy.

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And therefore because the policy allows access

80
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
to the S3 Buckets

81
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
then the user can access our S3 Buckets right now.

82
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
If we have an EC2 instance and want to give access

83
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
from the EC2 instance into the S3 Buckets,

84
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
we've seen that IAM users are not appropriate.

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
We need to use IAM roles instead.

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So we create an EC2 instance role

87
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
with the correct IAM permissions

88
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
and that EC2 instance will be able to access

89
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
the Amazon S3 Buckets.

90
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
More advanced,

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
if we want to allow Cross-Account Access,

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
then we must use the Bucket Policy.

93
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So we have an IAM user in another AWS account

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and we create an S3 Bucket policy

95
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
that allows Cross-Account Access for that specific IAM user

96
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
and therefore the IAM user will be able to make API calls

97
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
into our S3 Buckets.

98
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Other security settings you need to know about

99
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
is that there is the Bucket settings

100
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
for Block Public Access.

101
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So this is what we set to own when we created the Buckets

102
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and these settings were invented by AWS

103
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
as a extra layer of security to prevent company data leaks.

104
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So even though you would set an S3 Bucket policy

105
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
that would make it public,

106
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
if these settings are enabled,

107
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
the Bucket will never be public.

108
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So this is to prevent data leaks.

109
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So if you know that your Bucket should never be public,

110
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
then leave these settings on

111
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
and you have this level of security

112
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
against people who would set the wrong S3 Bucket policy.

113
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And if you know that none

114
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
of your S3 Buckets ever should be public,

115
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
then you can set this at the account level.

116
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Okay, so that's it for S3-Security.

117
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Now let's go in the hands-on to practice.
