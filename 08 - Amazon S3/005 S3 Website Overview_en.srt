1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So now let's talk about how Amazon S3

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
can be used to create aesthetic websites.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So S3 can host static websites

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and have them accessible on the internet

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and the website URL will be depending

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
on the AWS region where you create this,

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
either this or that.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And they look very, very similar as you can tell.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
But the only difference is that here, you have a dash

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and here, you have a dot.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It doesn't really matter for you to remember this

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
but just so you know, here it is.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So we have an extra bucket

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and it will contain files, maybe HTML files, maybe images

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and then we're going to enable this to be compatible

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
with hosting a website.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So this is what it will look like with the corresponding URL

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and then the user will access our S3 buckets.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
But this will not work

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
if we don't have public reads enabled on our S3 buckets.

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And this is why in the first place,

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
in the last lecture we learned about S3 bucket policies.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So if you have a 403 forbidden error

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
after enabling your S3 bucket for reads,

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
then that means that your bucket is not public.

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Therefore, you must attach an S3 bucket policy

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
that allows it to be public.

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So that's it for this short lecture,

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
now let's go into the hands on to practice this.
