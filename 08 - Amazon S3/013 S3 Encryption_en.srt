00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So you might have one question

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
on S3 encryption at the exam,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
so here is a high level review of what that means.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The first one is server-side encryption,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
so it is by default whenever you create a bucket

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
or whenever you upload an object, it will be encrypted.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
What is server-side encryption?

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Well, the user uploads an object into Amazon S3,

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and then that object when it arrives in the bucket

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
is going to be encrypted by Amazon S3 for security purposes.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The idea is that the server is doing the encryption,

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and therefore we call this server-side encryption.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
On the opposite, we have client-side encryption.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This is when the user will actually take the file,

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
will encrypt it before uploading it,

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
so the lock is done by the user,

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and then put it in the bucket.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And that's called client-side encryption.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And both models exist in AWS,

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
but by default you should know

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
that server-side encryption is always on.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
All right, that's it.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
