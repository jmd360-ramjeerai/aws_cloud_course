1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
So, just a quick lecture

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
on IAM Access Analyzer for Amazon S3,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
which is something that can come up

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
in the exam in one question.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So, what is this?

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Well, this is a monitoring feature

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
for your Amazon S3 buckets to ensure

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
that only the intended people have access

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
to your S3 buckets.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So, how does that work?

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Well, it's going to analyze your Bucket Policies,

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
your S3 ACLs, your S3 Access Point Policies,

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and so on, and is going to surface to you

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
which buckets are going to be publicly accessible,

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
which buckets have been shared

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
with other AWS accounts and so on.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And the idea is that you can review this and say, okay,

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
this is normal, this is expected, or this looks a bit

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
as a security issue because I did not intend

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
to share this bucket with these people,

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and therefore, you can take action.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And this is powered by IAM Access Analyzer,

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
which allows you to find out resources in your account

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
that are shared with other entities.

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So, I hope that makes sense.

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I hope you like this lecture

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and I will see you in the next lecture.
