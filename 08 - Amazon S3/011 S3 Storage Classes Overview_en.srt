1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Okay, so let's discuss

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
different storage classes we have for Amazon S three.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The first one is Amazon S three Standard-General Purpose.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Then we have Amazon S three-Infrequent Access.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Then we have Amazon S three One Zone-Infrequent Access.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Then we have Glacier Instant Retrieval,

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Glacier Flexible Retrieval, Glacier Deep Archive,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and then finally, the Amazon S three Intelligent Tiering.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So we'll learn about all these classes in depth

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
in this lecture, but you have to know them for the exam.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Then when you create an object in Amazon S three,

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
you can choose its class,

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
you can also modify its storage class manually,

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
or as we'll see as well,

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
you can use Amazon S3 Lifecycle configurations

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
to move objects automatically

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
between all these storage classes.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So first, before we go into the classes,

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
let's define the concept of durability and availability.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So durability represents how many times an object

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
is going to be lost by Amazon S three.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And so Amazon S three has a very high durability.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's called 11 nines.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So nine nine point and then nine times nine percent.

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And that means that on average,

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
if you store 10 million objects on Amazon S three,

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
you can expect to lose a single object

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
once every 10,000 years.

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So it's quite durable.

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And the durability is the same

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
for all storage classes in Amazon S three.

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Availability represents how readily a service is.

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And so this depends on the storage class.

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
For example, S three Standard has a 99.99% availability.

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That means that about 53 minutes a year,

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
the service is not going to be available.

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That means that you'll get some errors

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
when you deal with the service.

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So you need to take that into account

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
when you develop your applications.

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Okay.

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So S3 standard has 99.99 availability.

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's going to be used for frequently accessed data.

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
This is the kind of storage you use by default,

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
and it has low latency and high throughputs.

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It can sustain two concurrent facility failures

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
on the side of AWS and the use cases for it

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
is going to be big data analytics,

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
mobile and gaming application,

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
as well as content distribution.

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Next, we have S three infrequent access.

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So this is data that is going to be as the name indicates,

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
less frequently accessed,

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
but requires rapid access when needed.

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's going to be lower cost than S three Standard,

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
but you will have a cost on retrieval.

57
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So the S three Standard-IA is 99.9% availability,

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
so a bit less available.

59
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And the use case for it is going to be Disaster Recovery

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
and backups.

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And Amazon S three One Zone-Infrequent access, One Zone-IA.

62
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
ESC has high durability, okay, within a single AZ only,

63
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
and the data is going to be lost

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
if the AZ is somewhat destroyed.

65
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
As well as durability, it's even lower.

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So it's 99.5% availability.

67
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And so the use cases of S three One Zone-IA

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
is to store secondary copy of backups

69
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
of maybe on-premises data, or data you can recreate.

70
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Next we have the Glacier Storage Classes.

71
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So Glacier is, as the name it gets very cold,

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
so it's low cost object storage

73
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
meant for archiving and backup.

74
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And the pricing is that you're going to pay for the storage

75
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
plus pay for a retrieval cost.

76
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
In your three classes of storage within Glacier,

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
you have the Amazon S three Glacier Instant Retrieval.

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And this gives you milliseconds retrieval

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
which is great for example,

80
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
for data that's accessed once a quarter,

81
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
and the minimum store duration is 90 days.

82
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So this is backup,

83
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
but you need to access it within milliseconds.

84
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Then we have the Glacier Flexible Retrieval.

85
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It used to be called Amazon S three Glacier

86
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
but then they renamed things as they added more tier.

87
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So the Amazon Glacier Flexible Retrieval

88
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
has three flexibility.

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So you have expedited where you get the data back

90
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
between one and five minutes.

91
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You have standard to get the data back

92
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
between three to five hours, or bulk, which is free,

93
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
where you get data back between five to 12 hours.

94
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And the minimum storage duration as well is 90 days.

95
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So here, instance means you retrieve data instantly

96
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
and flexible means that you're willing

97
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
to wait up to for example, 12 hours to retrieve your data.

98
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And then we have Glacier Deep Archive

99
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
which is meant for long term storage.

100
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So we have two tiers of retrieval as well.

101
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We have Standard of 12 hours and Bulk of 48 hours.

102
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So you may be ready to wait a lot of time

103
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
to retrieve data,

104
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
but it's going to give you the lowest cost,

105
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
and as well, the minimum storage duration is 180 days.

106
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So as you know, that's a lot of storage classes

107
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and there's one last called S three Intelligent- Tiering,

108
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
which is going to allow you to move objects

109
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
between excess tiers based on usage patterns.

110
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And for this, you're going to incur a small

111
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
monthly monitoring fee, and auto tiering fee.

112
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And there are no retrieval charges

113
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
in S three Intelligent- Tiering.

114
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So there is the frequent access tier that's automatic

115
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
the default tier.

116
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Then we have the Infrequent Access tier

117
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
for objects not accessed for example, for 30 days.

118
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Then you have the Archive Instant Access tier,

119
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
automatic as well for objects not accessed over 90 days.

120
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And then the Archive Access tier that's optional.

121
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And you can configure it from 90 days to 700 plus days.

122
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And then you have the Deep Archive Access tier

123
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
also optional, that you can configure for objects

124
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
that haven't been accessed between 180 days

125
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
to 700 plus days.

126
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Okay.

127
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So S three Intelligent-Tiering is really

128
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
to allow you to just sit back and relax

129
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
while S three moves objects for you.

130
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So if you compare all the storage classes

131
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
you don't need to remember these numbers,

132
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
but it's just for you to make sense of what they are.

133
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So you get durability of 11 nine's everywhere.

134
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Then as availability goes down, the less zones you have,

135
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
of course.

136
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It just shows you like for example

137
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
the minimum storage duration chart and so on.

138
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So take some time to look at this diagram on your own.

139
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You should understand it,

140
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
but you should not remember it for sure.

141
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So if we look at some pricing, for example

142
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
in the us-east-one,

143
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
so this is the kind of pricing you would have

144
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
for all the storage classes.

145
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And again, you're not supposed to remember everything.

146
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But it's good for you to have a look at it

147
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
on your own time, just to make sure you understand.

148
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Because if you understand what the classes name are,

149
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
then you should be able to make sense of these classes.

150
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Okay?

151
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So that's it for the lecture.

152
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I hope you liked it.

153
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And I will see you in the next lecture.
