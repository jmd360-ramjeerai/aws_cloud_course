1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So now let's talk about ECS.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
ECS stands for elastic container service,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and this is used to launch the docker containers

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
we just talked about on AWS.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
For it to work,

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
we need the docker containers to run somewhere,

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and so for ECS, you must provision

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and maintain the infrastructure yourself.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So that means you need to create EC2 instances in advance.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
AWS will take care of starting

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
or stopping the containers for you,

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and it has integration

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
with an application balancer,

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
if you want to create a web application on ECS.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So as a diagram, you would have multiple EC2 instances

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and we would need to create these EC2 instances in advance

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and they will be running different containers

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
by the ECS service.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Now the ECS service,

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
any times it has a new docker container,

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
it will be smart enough to find on which EC2 instance

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
to place that docker container.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So anytime in the exam you see,

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I want to run docker containers on AWS, think of ECS.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Now let's talk about Fargate.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So Fargate is also used to launch docker containers on AWS.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
But this time with Fargate,

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
we don't need to provision any infrastructure.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So we don't need to create any EC2 instances

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and manage them.

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And this is a much more simple offering from AWS.

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This is actually a serverless offering

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
because we don't manage any servers.

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
AWS will just run the containers that we need

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
based on the specification

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
of CPU and RAM for each container.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So Fargate is going to be a lot simpler to use

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and I like it personally a lot.

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Fargate is here.

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Say we have to have a new docker container

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
to be run on Fargate, then Fargate will

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
automatically run that container for us.

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We don't exactly know where, but it will be run.

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And so the idea here is that with Fargate,

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
we don't manage any EC2 instances

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and so it is easier to use.

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So before with ECS, we first created our EC2 instances,

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
but with Fargate, we don't.

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But both services will allow you

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
to run docker container on AWS.

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Finally, for storing these docker images,

52
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
so that it can be run on the AWS,

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
you need to use a container registry.

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And for this, we can use ECR,

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
which stands for elastic container registry.

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It is a private docker registry on AWS,

57
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and this is where you're going to store you docker images

58
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
so that it can be run

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
by the ECS service or the Fargate service.

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So the second example,

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
we have ECR and Fargate.

62
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We're going to store our images of our application

63
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
onto Amazon ECR, and then Fargate will be able

64
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
to look at these images and create a container from them,

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and run them directly on the Fargate service.

66
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So it could be one container here, one container there,

67
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
but this is ECR, so we could have multiple images as well,

68
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
creating different containers on Fargate.

69
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So that's it.

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Very, very simple.

71
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So remember, ECS versus Fargate versus ECR,

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
that's all you need to know going into the exam.

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I hope you liked it,

74
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
and I will see you in the next lecture.
