00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Amazon Lightsail is a bit of an oddball in AWS

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
because it is kind of a stand-alone service.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So with Lightsail,

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
you can get virtual servers,

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,000
storage,

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
databases

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and networking in one place.

8
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It gives you low and predictable pricing.

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And so the reason people use Amazon Lightsail

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
is that it is a much simpler alternative

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
to using services

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
that we've been learning

13
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
such as EC2 RDS, ELB, EBS, Route53 and so on.

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So Lightsail really the intent of it from AWS

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
is for people that have little cloud experience

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and don't want to learn

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
how the services work intricately,

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
for example,

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
how their networking works,

20
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
how the storage works,

21
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
the server works etc.

22
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This is not something you would use

23
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
your learning how AWS works properly

24
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
but if you're someone with little

25
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
to no cloud experience

26
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
then Lightsail maybe a service for you.

27
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
From Lightsail you can also set up some monitoring

28
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and notifications for your Lightsail resources

29
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and so use cases for Lightsail would be

30
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
for example,

31
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
if you want to deploy a very simple web application

32
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,000
for example,

33
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
if you have LAMP Stack, Nginx, MEAN, Node.js

34
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
there's templates for that on Lightsail

35
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
or if you have a very simple website,

36
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
for example,

37
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
if you have a WordPress and Magento,

38
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Plesk, Joomla

39
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
all these kind of things can be deployed

40
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
very easily on Lightsail.

41
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Finally, Lightsail is also great

42
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
if you have development and test environments in AWS.

43
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
There is a concept of high availability in Lightsail

44
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
but there's no auto-scaling

45
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and there really are limited AWS integrations.

46
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So to summarize,

47
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Lightsail really is something

48
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
that you wouldn't use today on your own

49
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
but from an exam perspective

50
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
if you see someone

51
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
that has no cloud experience

52
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and need to get started quickly

53
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
with a low and predictable pricing

54
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
without configuring things much

55
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
that will be Lightsail,

56
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
otherwise Lightsail will almost

57
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
always be a wrong answer.

58
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So I hope that was helpful

59
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and I will see you in the next lecture.
