1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So we are getting into the ECS Section,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
but before talking about ECS we need to talk about Docker.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So Docker is something you may have heard before.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'll try to simplify it.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You can make a 12 hour long course on Docker.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We'll try to make it short in four minutes.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So what is Docker?

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Docker is a software development platform to deploy apps.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So the way we've been deploying applications from before

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
is to install them on Linux

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and then they will work,

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
but with Docker, you will package your app

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
into something called a container

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and that container is very special,

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
because it can be run on any operating system very easily.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The app, once in a container

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
will run the exact same way,

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
regardless of where they're run.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So it could be any machine,

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
no compatibility issues with predictable behavior,

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
less work, easier to maintain and deploy.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It will work with any programming language,

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
any operating system, any technology

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and with Docker you can scale containers up and down

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
very quickly in a matter of seconds.

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So that makes Docker

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
something that is extremely powerful nowadays

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
to deploy applications.

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So if we talk about Docker on an EC2 Instance,

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
we would have, for example,

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
a Docker running Java code,

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
a Docker running NodeJS code,

33
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
a Docker running in My SQL Database,

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
a Docker running Java and so on

35
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
all onto the same EC2 Instance.

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So the idea is that if we managed to package our application

37
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
in a Docker container,

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
then it will become very easy for us to run it

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
on an EC2 Instance.

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So Docker images, you need to create them.

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
This is how your container will be run

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and they can be stored

43
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
in something called Docker Repositories.

44
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So there is a public Docker Repository called the Docker Hub

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
available at this address.

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And you can find the base images for many technologies

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
or operating systems.

48
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So for Ubuntu, which is a Linux Operating System,

49
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
or My SQL, this is a database technology,

50
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
NodeJS Java Programming Languages

51
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
or as we'll see in this section,

52
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
we can use Amazon ECR,

53
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
which is a private Docker Repository.

54
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This is where you can store your private Docker images.

55
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So this is more advanced,

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
but the question is, do you wanna use Docker

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
or virtual machine?

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So Docker is sort of a visualization technology,

59
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
but not exactly.

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So the resources are shared with a host.

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That means that you can have many containers on one server.

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So if we look at comparing EC2 and Docker,

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
this is all in the works.

64
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So we have the infrastructure which is on AWS,

65
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
the Host Operating System,

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
then the Hypervisor

67
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and this is stuff we don't have access to.

68
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And then finally, when we get an EC2 Instance,

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
we have our application onto the Guest Operating System

70
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
and so if we want another EC2 Instance,

71
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
it will be created like this

72
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and a third EC2 Instance, it will be credited like that.

73
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So this works great

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
and this is what happens when we create EC2 Instances.

75
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But in the case of Docker, we have the infrastructure,

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
the Host OS which is the EC2 Instance

77
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and then the Docker Daemon.

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And then as soon as the Docker Daemon is running,

79
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
we can have many containers running on to the Docker Daemon

80
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
and they're more light weights.

81
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
They don't package,

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
they don't come with a full operating system

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
and a virtual machine, all of them.

84
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And so that makes Docker very versatile, very easy to scale

85
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
and very easy to run.

86
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So this is just an overview of Docker.

87
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You don't need to know what Docker is going into the exam,

88
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
but I wanted to give you that sweet little overview

89
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
in case you were curious

90
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,000
and in the next lecture,

91
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
we'll deal about how to do Docker on AWS

92
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
and that will be ECS.

93
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So I will see you in the next lecture.
