1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So now, I want to formally introduce

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
the Serverless Section to you.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So what is severless?

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Severless is a catchy word but it is a new paradigm

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
in which the developers don't manage the servers anymore.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
They just do what they do best,

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
they just deploy the codes or they deploy functions.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So initially, serverless was pioneered

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
as a Function as a Service with AWS Lambda,

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and that means that you just deploy your code

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and each function will be run independently

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
by the Lambda service, but nowadays,

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
anything that's serverless

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
is mostly mentioned as something that is managed

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and that does include servers managed by the user

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
so that includes serverless databases,

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
messaging, storage, et cetera.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So serverless does not mean that there are no servers.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
There are, of course, servers behind the scenes.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Otherwise, services would not work,

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
but it just means that as an end user,

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
you don't manage, provision, or even see the servers.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So in this course,

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
we have been using some serverless services

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
from the beginning.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So Amazon S3 was one of them

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
because we used it as a storage layer,

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
but we didn't manage any servers at all, okay?

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Amazon S3 can scale infinitely, there was no servers,

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
it was just uploaded file, and that was it.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
DynamoDB was another one.

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So in DynamoDB, we just went ahead, we created a table,

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
but we didn't provision a server for that table,

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and that server was, that table could auto scale

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
based on the load it was receiving.

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So that makes it another serverless service.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Fargate is another one

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
so Fargate was to run Docker containers,

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and as I said with ECS, you create EC2 instances

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
to run the Docker containers

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
so that would not be serverless, but with Fargate,

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
you just send the Docker containers

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and Fargate will automatically find a way for it to be run

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
so that makes it another serverless service,

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and in this section, we're going to see Lambda,

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
which was the pioneer of serverless services.

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So Lambda allows you to run functions in the cloud.

48
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So this is it for the quick intro to serverless,

49
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I will see you in the next lecture to talk about Lambda.
