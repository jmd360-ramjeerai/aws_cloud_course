1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So I want to quickly show you

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
what Lightsail looks like

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
we're not going to play much with it.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
But I want to show you what it looks like.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So Lightsail, as you can see, looks nothing like AWS,

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
it is a separate service

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
because it doesn't have any kind

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
of good integrations with AWS.

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So let's get started with Lightsail.

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
They need you to create an instance.

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And so say, where is this going to be.

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And so as you can see, you can change the region

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and the AZ from here for that instance.

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And there's limited amount of regions available to you.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So for example, we can set at one in Ireland,

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
then based on where you select your instance to be,

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
you're going to get some parameters

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
to configure your instance,

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
but you're going to get a lot less.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
so you can pick an instance image

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
which would correspond to an AMI a but again,

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
all these things are hidden from you in lightsail.

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And so for example, we can say okay,

24
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
we want to use a blueprint such as a template,

25
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and we can use the OS only.

26
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This would be very similar to EC2,

27
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
but we can go with App NOS for example.

28
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We can say okay,

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I want to launch a WordPress websites right now.

30
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and you click on this And you have a WordPress website.

31
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So as you can see,

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
lightsail is a much lighter as the name indicates.

33
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And it's really meant for you to be quickly up

34
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and going on AWS without understanding,

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
the entire infrastructure that goes behind it.

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So this is for very simple applications.

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So we can have an optional launch grid,

38
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
which is an EC2 use data,

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
we can change the SSH key pair if you wanted to.

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But you can see all these things are kind of hidden.

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
They don't want you

42
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
to modify these parameters well, right away.

43
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The cool thing here is the instance plan.

44
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So we have a lot less customization here,

45
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
we don't see the EC2 instance types,

46
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
we just see some instances with a price indicated,

47
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
so it's easy to understand the price is going to cost me

48
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
For example, this one will cost me 3.5 USD,

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
but it's the first month is going to be free.

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So maybe that's the one I want.

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And we can see how much RAM CPU I get and disk space.

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So this is really, really easy to use.

53
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
As you can see,

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
we don't have that many instance types possible.

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We can go all the way to one

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
that costs 160 US dollars per month,

57
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and we see 32 gigabytes of memory, eight VCPU 640 ASG

58
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and seven terabytes of network transfer,

59
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
so fairly easy, I'm going to just pick this one

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
because it's in the free tier,

61
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and then you have to make sure you delete at the end.

62
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So it's going to be WordPress one,

63
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and it will create this instance.

64
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So we can see here, no security groups, no networking,

65
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
no EBS volumes, really, it's meant to be very, very simple.

66
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And that's the main idea behind lightsail.

67
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So while this instance is pending, again,

68
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
we can go ahead and create,

69
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
we could go ahead and create a database.

70
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So you could create database and again,

71
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
this is not RDS, this is lightsail.

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So it's going to be much more easy.

73
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You choose again, the region

74
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
and the AZ you pick the database type.

75
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And then you can specify some credentials for the login,

76
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
if you want to standard database or high availability,

77
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
and then the price you're willing to pay.

78
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And again, this database right here,

79
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
will get you the first month three,

80
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
but then you would be $15 per month.

81
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So as you can see, again,

82
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
it's a very simplified version of AWS,

83
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
hence the name lightsail.

84
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We could do the same with networking.

85
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I won't show you right now.

86
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But you can create all these three things,

87
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
including a load balancer,

88
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
In the networking section,

89
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
we could do storage to get some more storage disk

90
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
and snapshots for your backups.

91
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So this is a very simplified one view of AWS.

92
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Now let's look at our WordPress.

93
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So here, if I click here,

94
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
this actually gets me into an SSH terminal,

95
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
into my EC2 instance.

96
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So I need to wait a little bit for it to boot up.

97
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So if I now try again,

98
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm able to connect to my instance using,

99
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
a version of SSH through the browser.

100
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So again, it's really intended to be very easy to be used.

101
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So we're not going to do any commands on the SSH.

102
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But as we can see a WordPress was deployed.

103
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And so I can click on it and view it

104
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
and then we can connect using SSH again from the same thing.

105
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But if we look at the public IP that is running,

106
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
and open this in a new tab,

107
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
then we're going to connect into our WordPress instance.

108
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And so we are getting our hello world blog.

109
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And I'm not a WordPress expert.

110
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So I'm not going to show you how to modify this,

111
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
but the idea is that yes,

112
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Something is being created on our instance.

113
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And that was very, very easy.

114
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So lightsail, I hope you get an idea of what it is.

115
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's meant to be a lightweight version of AWS,

116
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
but it's not something you're going to use

117
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
in your job, I believe as a RDS developer,

118
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
as a subs lab practitioners, solutions architect, etc, etc.

119
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Still a good idea to know about the service

120
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
and it can come up at, the exam, usually as a destructor.

121
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Very, very rarely as a service you should get the answer of.

122
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So that's it when you're done,

123
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
please make sure to delete that instance.

124
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So you click on delete,

125
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
and then delete the instance

126
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
so that you don't incur any charges.

127
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So that's it. I hope you liked it,

128
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
and I will see you in the next lecture.
