1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now, let's talk about Amazon EKS.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So EKS is for Elastic Kubernetes Service,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and this allows you to launch and manage

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Kubernetes cluster on AWS.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So what is Kubernetes?

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Well, that's this blue logo right here,

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and so Kubernetes is an open source system

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
that is used for the management, deployment,

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and scaling of containerized applications,

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
usually, managed by Docker containers,

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
but could be other types of containers as well.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So these containers and these pods

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
can be hosted on either EC2 instances or using Fargate,

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
if you want it to be fully serverless.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So if you use an EKS cluster,

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
a Kubernetes cluster managed by EKS,

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
then you're going to have, for example, EKS nodes,

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
for example, in this case, there are EC2 instances.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And so, whenever you launch a Docker container

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
on your Kubernetes cluster,

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
automatically, pods are going to be launched

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
onto your EC2 instances.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So why would you use Kubernetes on Amazon EKS?

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Well, launching Kubernetes is quite hard,

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and so using a managed service

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
to manage your Kubernetes cluster is a great idea,

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
hence the idea behind Amazon EKS.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And why should you use Kubernetes?

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Well, if you are using multiple clouds

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
or even on-premises infrastructure,

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
then Kubernetes can run everywhere,

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and so therefore, this is cloud agnostic,

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and therefore, learning Kubernetes can allow you

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
to learn how to launch containers anywhere would be on AWS,

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
but also Azure or GCP or anywhere else, and that's the idea.

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
From an exam perspective,

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
you will just see the word Kubernetes,

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
and you have to think about Amazon EKS.

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
All right, that's it, I hope you liked it,

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and I will see you in the next lecture.
